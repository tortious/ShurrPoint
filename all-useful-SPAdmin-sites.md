SharePoint Admin & Useful URLs && SharePoint REST API Endpoint URL List - 450+ Links

I compiled a list of \~250 Site/Site Collection Admin Links, as well as a variety of other useful links for Site Administration shortcuts. I tested these on SP Online only. If you aren't completely familiar with the URL structure, it is https://<YourTenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<YourSite>/  <-- Then the rest of the url on the linked google sheet.

For the members of the sub who use the REST API, there are \~230  endpoint URLs on the other sheet.   


Where possible, I tried to include required parameters/inputs.
