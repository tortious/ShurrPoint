Below is an expanded and more detailed guide to Power Automate Flows, picking up at Section 3. I’ll include step-by-step instructions, ASCII-style visuals, and deep explanations for each key concept and action. The idea is that by the end of this guide, you’ll not only understand what to click, but why you’re clicking it and what’s happening under the hood.

3. Fundamental Building Blocks

Before we dive into specific flows, let’s break down the foundational elements that make up Power Automate:

3.1 Types of Flows
	1.	Automated Cloud Flow
	•	Use Case: Triggers automatically when an event occurs, e.g., “When a file is created” in SharePoint.
	•	Example: You add a new Word document in your SharePoint document library. As soon as that file arrives, a flow can automatically send an email notification.
	•	Why it’s useful: You don’t have to remember to run it. It’s triggered by an external event.
	2.	Instant Cloud Flow
	•	Use Case: You manually trigger this type of flow—often with a button or from the Power Automate mobile app.
	•	Example: You have a “Send quick approval request” button. When you click it, the flow starts.
	•	Why it’s useful: You control exactly when it runs.
	3.	Scheduled Cloud Flow
	•	Use Case: Runs on a time-based schedule, such as once an hour, once a day, or once a week.
	•	Example: Every morning at 8 AM, the flow checks your “Jeff List” for items due in 7 days and sends out reminders.
	•	Why it’s useful: Good for routine tasks or regular data processing.
	4.	Desktop Flow (RPA)
	•	Use Case: Automates tasks on your local machine (Robot Process Automation). Interacts with old or non-API-based applications by simulating mouse clicks and keyboard input.
	•	Example: Automating form entry in a local legacy application.
	•	Why it’s useful: If you have older systems that don’t integrate well with the cloud, this is your fallback.

3.2 Connectors & Permissions

When you build flows, you use connectors to talk to external services:
	•	SharePoint connector: For SharePoint actions like “Get file content,” “Create item,” “Move file,” etc.
	•	Outlook (Office 365 Outlook) connector: For email-based actions, like “Send an email (V2).”
	•	Teams connector: For posting messages to a channel.
	•	Conditions & Approvals: Built-in Power Automate features that let you route tasks for acceptance or rejection.

Important:
	•	Make sure your user account (the one you’re using to build flows) has sufficient permissions on the SharePoint site and mailbox. For example, if you’re working with a particular SharePoint library, you must have at least Contribute permissions there.

3.3 Understanding Dynamic Content & Expressions
	•	Dynamic Content: The automatically generated fields (metadata) from previous steps.
	•	Example: If your trigger is “When a file is created,” you’ll see dynamic content like File Name, File Identifier, Site Address, etc.
	•	Expressions: A way to do advanced logic. Power Automate uses an expression language based on Azure Logic Apps’ workflow definition language.

Example Expression:

contains(triggerOutputs()?['body/Name'], 'Invoice')

	•	This checks if the newly uploaded file’s name contains the word “Invoice.”

4. Essential SharePoint Flows

This section walks through the most common flows you’d build for SharePoint-based legal document management. We’ll illustrate each flow’s step-by-step process in detail, including why each step matters.

4.1 Trigger: “When a file is created (properties only)”

This is the building block for flows that need to automatically react whenever someone uploads a document to a particular document library.

4.1.1 Step-by-Step Creation
	1.	Navigate to Power Automate
	•	Go to https://make.powerautomate.com/ in your browser.
	•	Sign in with your Microsoft 365 credentials.
	2.	Create a New Flow
	•	Click Create on the left panel.
	•	Under “Start from blank,” choose “Automated cloud flow.”
	3.	Name Your Flow & Choose Trigger
	•	Enter a name (e.g., “Notify me when a file is created”).
	•	In the “Choose your flow’s trigger” search box, type SharePoint.
	•	Select “When a file is created (properties only)” and click Create.
	4.	Configure the Trigger
	•	Site Address: Choose the SharePoint site where your library lives.
	•	Library Name: Select the specific document library you want to monitor.

Visual Representation:

+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Flow: Notify me when a file is created                 |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Trigger: When a file is created (properties only)      |
|   - Site Address: https://YourTenant.sharepoint.com/...|
|   - Library Name: [Your Document Library]              |
+--------------------------------------------------------+

(No actions yet, just the trigger.)

Why This Trigger?
	•	“When a file is created (properties only)” is immediate and picks up file metadata (like name, path, etc.). It does not automatically provide the file’s content, so if you need to attach the file to an email, you’ll add a “Get file content” step next.

4.2 Basic Email Flow with Attachments

We’ll expand on the previous trigger to send an email with the newly uploaded file as an attachment.

4.2.1 Step-by-Step
	1.	Start from the Trigger (Previous Step)
	•	You have “When a file is created (properties only)” configured.
	2.	Add New Step – “Get file content”
	•	Click + New step.
	•	Search for “Get file content” (SharePoint).
	•	Site Address: Same site as your trigger.
	•	File Identifier: Use dynamic content from the trigger (called Identifier).
	3.	Add Next Step – “Send an email (V2)”
	•	Search for “Send an email (V2)” in the Outlook or Office 365 Outlook connector.
	•	Configure:
	•	To: The email address(es) you want to notify.
	•	Subject: “New Document: [File Name]”
	•	Body: “A new file has been uploaded to the library.”
	•	Attachments:
	•	Click Add new item in the Attachments section.
	•	Name: Select the DisplayName (or you can type FileName from dynamic content).
	•	Content: Select File Content from the “Get file content” step.

Visual Representation:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Flow: Notify me and attach new file                                               |
+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 1) Trigger: When a file is created    |                                           |
|    (properties only)                  |                                           |
|   - Site: [Your Site]                 |                                           |
|   - Library: [Target Library]         |                                           |
+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 2) Action: Get file content          |  <-- Using the Trigger's File Identifier   |
|   - Site: [Your Site]                |                                           |
|   - File Identifier: [Identifier]    | (from dynamic content)                     |
+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 3) Action: Send an email (V2)        |                                           |
|   - To: [Recipient Email]            | e.g., yourboss@company.com                 |
|   - Subject: "New Document: [Name]"  | Insert dynamic file name into subject      |
|   - Body: "A new file was uploaded." |                                           |
|   - Attachments:                     |                                           |
|        Name: [DisplayName]           | from "When a file is created" or "Get file"|
|        Content: [File Content]       | from "Get file content" step              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Why These Steps?
	•	Get file content: You need the raw file bits to attach it to the email. The trigger alone only gives you the metadata, not the actual file data.
	•	Send an email (V2): Best for Microsoft 365 work or corporate environments. (V3 is typically for personal Outlook accounts.)

4.3 Conditional Flows & Filtering File Types

Scenario: You only want to email yourself if the uploaded file is a PDF. For any other file type, do nothing (or handle differently).

4.3.1 Step-by-Step
	1.	Trigger: Same as before, “When a file is created (properties only).”
	2.	Add Condition
	•	After the trigger, choose + New step → Control → Condition.
	•	In the Condition:
	•	Left Value: Select File Name (dynamic content) or “Name” from the trigger.
	•	Operator: “ends with”
	•	Right Value: “.pdf”
	3.	Inside the Condition:
	•	If yes (True): The file name ends with .pdf
	•	Add the steps for “Get file content” → “Send an email” as shown before.
	•	If no (False): The file name doesn’t end with .pdf
	•	Optionally do nothing, or add alternative logic (e.g., notify a different address).

Visual Representation:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1) Trigger: When a file is created (properties only)                     |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2) Condition: "Name" ends with ".pdf"                                   |
|         +--------------+-----------------------------------+-------------+
|         | Yes (true)   |                                   | No (false) |
|         | (It's a PDF) |                                   | (Not PDF)  |
+---------+--------------+-----------------------------------+-------------+
          | Actions for PDF files:                                         |
          |   a) Get file content                                         |
          |   b) Send an email with PDF as attachment                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Why Condition?
	•	Conditions help you filter or branch your flow’s logic. If a file doesn’t meet certain criteria, you don’t want to do the same set of actions.

4.4 Handling Updates (Versioning)

Scenario: If you want your flow to react not only when a new file is uploaded, but any time a file is modified.

4.4.1 Step-by-Step
	1.	Trigger: “When a file is created or modified (properties only)”
	•	Notice “or modified” instead of just “created.”
	2.	Configuration:
	•	Site Address: Your site
	•	Library Name: The library to monitor

Caution:
	•	This trigger will fire every time a file’s properties change. If your environment has versioning enabled, that could generate multiple versions quickly, possibly triggering the flow more often than intended.

Common Approaches:
	•	Add a Condition to check if a particular column changed (e.g., “Status” column from “Draft” to “Final”).
	•	Or check the version label if available.

5. Approval & Notification Flows

Legal documents often require sign-off from an attorney or a supervisor. Power Automate’s built-in approval system helps with that.

5.1 Single Approver Flow

Let’s build a flow that automatically requests approval from a single person (e.g., Mark) whenever a new draft pleading is uploaded.

5.1.1 Step-by-Step
	1.	Trigger: “When a file is created (properties only)”
	•	Site: [Your Site]
	•	Library: e.g., “Pleadings Library”
	2.	Condition (optional): Check if File Name contains “draft.”
	•	Condition: Name contains “draft”
	•	If true → Move on; if false → do nothing.
	3.	Action: “Start and wait for an approval”
	•	Approval Type: Approve/Reject – First to respond (for single approver).
	•	Title: “Approval needed: [File Name]”
	•	Assigned To: Mark’s email (e.g., mark@yourfirm.com)
	•	Details: “Please approve the attached document or reject.”
	4.	Configure the Approval
	•	Optionally: Attach the file by using “Get file content” → Then in the advanced options of “Start and wait for approval,” you can add an attachment.
	•	This ensures Mark can open and review the actual document from the approval center.
	5.	Condition: The result of the approval
	•	If “Outcome” = “Approve,” send an email to the person who uploaded the file.
	•	If “Outcome” = “Reject,” send an email with comments on why it was rejected.

Visual Representation:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Flow: Approval for Draft Pleading                                                      |
+---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Trigger: When a file is created       | Site: [Your Site]                              |
| (properties only)                     | Library: [Pleadings Library]                   |
+---------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Condition: "Name" contains "draft"   | Yes -> proceed; No -> do nothing               |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Yes Branch ->   | 1) Action: Get file content          | 2) Action: Start & wait for   |
|                 |   - Use "Identifier" from trigger    |    approval (Approver: Mark)  |
|                 +--------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|                 |   (Optional: Attach file to approval)| Details: "Approve or reject." |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------+-------------------------------+
| Next: Condition: if "Outcome" = "Approve" or "Reject"                                  |
|   - Approve -> Send email: "Your document was approved!"                               |
|   - Reject -> Send email: "Document was rejected. Comments: [Response]"                |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Why “Start and wait for an approval”?
	•	Simplifies the process: you don’t need separate “Start approval” and “Wait for approval” steps—this single action handles both.

5.2 Parallel or Sequential Approvals
	•	Sequential Approvals: One after another (e.g., a senior attorney must approve first, then the client must approve second).
	•	Parallel Approvals: Everyone sees the request at the same time. The flow continues once all (or first) respond.

Setting This Up:
	•	In “Start and wait for approval,” choose “Approve/Reject – Everyone must approve” (for parallel) or manually chain multiple approval steps for sequential.

5.3 Custom Notifications via Teams or Email

Instead of just emailing, you can post updates in a Teams channel:
	•	After the approval step, add an action: “Post a message in Teams”.
	•	Provide:
	•	Team and Channel
	•	Message: “Document [FileName] was approved by [ApproverName].”

6. Advanced SharePoint Scenarios

Let’s explore deeper, more nuanced flows. For instance, if you need to do something that’s not available as a simple SharePoint action, you can use HTTP calls.

6.1 Moving Documents to Specific Folders

Scenario: If the file’s name or metadata indicates it’s a “Discovery” document, move it to the “Discovery Documents” folder automatically.

6.1.1 Step-by-Step
	1.	Trigger: “When a file is created (properties only)”
	2.	Condition: If Name contains “discovery” (not case-sensitive if you lower everything in expressions).
	3.	Action: “Move file” (SharePoint)
	•	Current Site Address: same as trigger
	•	File to Move: “Identifier” from trigger
	•	Destination Site Address: same (unless you’re moving across sites)
	•	Destination Folder: Library path plus “/Discovery Documents”

Visual Representation:

+--------------------------------------------------+
| Move Discovery Documents Flow                    |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Trigger: When a file is created (properties only)|
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Condition: File Name contains "discovery"        |
|   +--------------+-------------------------------+
|   | Yes (True)   | No (False)                   |
+---+--------------+-------------------------------+
|Yes-> Action: Move file                           |
|    - File: [Identifier]                          |
|    - Destination: /Discovery Documents           |
+--------------------------------------------------+

Why “Move file”?
	•	This action modifies the file location. If you just want to copy, there’s a Copy file action.
	•	If the file is open or locked, it might fail. That’s a common pitfall—locking can interfere with these moves.

6.2 Using HTTP Calls for Advanced Actions

Certain advanced scenarios—like creating Document Sets—aren’t directly available in standard actions. HTTP calls let you talk to the SharePoint REST API.

Example: Creating a new Document Set programmatically in a library.
	1.	Action: “Send an HTTP request to SharePoint”
	•	Site Address: Your site
	•	Method: POST
	•	URI: /_api/web/folders
	•	Headers: Content-Type: application/json;odata=verbose
	•	Body:

{
  "__metadata": { "type": "SP.Folder" },
  "ServerRelativeUrl": "/sites/SiteName/LibraryName/DocSetName"
}



Why This Might Be Necessary:
	•	Document Sets have special settings; standard “Create folder” actions might not set the correct content type or metadata you want.
	•	The HTTP approach is flexible but more complex.

6.3 Integrations with DocuSign or Adobe Sign

If you need electronic signatures:
	1.	Trigger: “When a file is created” or “For a selected file”
	2.	Action: DocuSign – Create Envelope (premium connector).
	3.	Action: DocuSign – Send Envelope
	4.	After signing, you can have a callback that places the signed document into SharePoint automatically.

6.4 Auto-Creating Document Sets & Templates

Scenario: Each time you add a new case to a “Cases” list, you want to create a standard document set of templates (e.g., “DiscoveryRequests.docx,” “MotionTemplate.docx”) in the “Pleadings” library.
	1.	Trigger: “When an item is created” in the Cases list.
	2.	Actions (HTTP or standard if available) to:
	•	Create a Document Set named after the new case (e.g., “Case #2025-14 – John Doe”).
	•	Copy or Move your template files into that new Document Set.

7. Specialized Legal Workflows

You’ve mentioned “Jeff List” and managing legal documents. Here are a few detailed examples:

7.1 “Jeff List” Use Cases
	1.	Trigger: “When an item is created or modified” on the Jeff List.
	2.	Condition: If Status is updated from “Draft” to “Filed,” then:
	•	Action: Send an email to your paralegal or to the attorney, “Case is now filed!”
	•	Action: Move or rename documents in the library to reflect the new status.

Excruciating Detail:
	•	You can add a hidden column to track the previous status vs. the new status. Then in the condition, only proceed if newStatus != oldStatus.

7.2 Auto-Updating Document Status

If you want the documents in SharePoint to automatically reflect the case status from the Jeff List:
	1.	Trigger: “When an item is modified” (Jeff List).
	2.	Action: “Get files (properties only)” from the document library, filtering by a column that matches the Case ID.
	3.	Apply to Each file:
	•	“Update file properties” → set the Status field to whatever the Jeff List item’s new status is.

Visual:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Flow: Sync Document Status with Jeff List                                     |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Trigger: When an item is modified (Jeff List)                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Action: Get files (properties only) from Documents Library                     |
|   Filter Query: CaseID eq [CaseID from Jeff List]                              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Action: Apply to Each [File in Results]                                        |
|   - Update file properties: Status = [New Status from Jeff List item]          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

7.3 Scheduled Reminders for Filing Deadlines

Scenario: Each morning, check the “Jeff List” to see if any items are due in 7 days.
	1.	Create: Scheduled cloud flow
	•	Frequency: Day
	•	Time: 8:00 AM local time
	2.	Action: “Get items” from the Jeff List.
	•	Use a Filter Query: DueDate eq '[addDays(utcNow(),7,'yyyy-MM-dd')]' (or local date handling).
	3.	For each item returned, “Send an email” → “Reminder: Your item is due in 7 days!”

7.4 Extracting Data from Emails & Creating SharePoint Items

Scenario: You receive an email with the subject “New Assignment” and want to create a new item in the Jeff List automatically.
	1.	Trigger: “When a new email arrives” (V3 or Office 365 Outlook)
	2.	Condition: If Subject contains “New Assignment”
	3.	Action: “Parse Email Body” or you can do a “Compose” with the email body to extract details.
	4.	Action: “Create item” in the Jeff List:
	•	Title = Subject
	•	Description = Body snippet
	•	Attach the email attachments to SharePoint if needed (use “Create file” in your library).

8. Managing & Monitoring Flows

Even the best flows need monitoring to ensure they run smoothly and to troubleshoot when something goes wrong.

8.1 Testing Flows
	1.	Save your flow in the Power Automate editor.
	2.	Trigger the flow manually:
	•	If it’s a “When a file is created” trigger, go to SharePoint and upload a sample file.
	3.	Flow Checker in the editor:
	•	If there are any errors, it flags them at the top right.

8.2 Checking Flow Runs & Errors
	1.	Go to My Flows in the left-hand navigation.
	2.	Select your flow → Click on “Run History.”
	3.	You’ll see a list of flow runs:
	•	Green checkmark = success
	•	Red exclamation = failure
	4.	Click on a failed run → Expand each step to see the error message or reason for failure.

8.3 Debugging Common Issues
	1.	Permissions:
	•	If the flow says “Access denied,” ensure your connection credentials are correct and that you have appropriate SharePoint or mailbox permissions.
	2.	File Locking:
	•	If a user has the file open in Word Online, “Get file content” or “Move file” can fail. Consider adding a Delay and retry logic.
	3.	Infinite Loops:
	•	If your flow updates the same item that triggers it, you can end up in a loop. Use a trigger condition or a specific column to detect real changes.

8.4 Best Practices to Avoid Loops & Performance Bottlenecks
	•	Trigger Conditions: Instead of firing the flow on every update, you can set conditions, e.g., only run if Status changes or if Modified By is not the flow’s account.
	•	Concurrency Control: If you’re updating thousands of files at once, enable concurrency in “Apply to each” step.
	•	API Call Limits: Microsoft 365 users have around 5,000 actions/day. Don’t build flows that process massive volumes every hour unless you have an appropriate plan.

Wrap-Up
By mastering these building blocks—Triggers, Actions, Conditions, Approvals, and HTTP calls—you can automate a wide range of legal workflows in SharePoint. Keep practicing with smaller flows before moving to complex scenarios. Always test thoroughly in a sandbox environment to avoid disruptions.

Where to Go Next?
	•	Practice with simple flows first.
	•	Gradually add conditions, approvals, and HTTP calls as you gain confidence.
	•	Explore advanced topics like Power Apps integration if you want custom forms feeding into these flows.

With the above sections (3–8) in excruciating detail, you should have a solid road map for building your own end-to-end automation in Power Automate. Good luck, and feel free to ask more targeted questions as you experiment!
