1. Introduction

Your SharePoint tenant is designed to support case management, document organization, and workflow automation for a small law firm. You’re leveraging SharePoint Online, Power Automate, PnP PowerShell, and other Microsoft 365 tools to create an efficient, scalable system for legal case management. The goal is to balance standardization with flexibility while optimizing automation for document and list management.

2. Current SharePoint Tenant Setup

2.1. Tenant Structure
	•	You have a hub site for case management, with individual team sites for each case.
	•	Lists are centralized at the hub level, ensuring a single source of truth for case-related data.
	•	Libraries are used within team sites to manage documents without relying on folders.

2.2. Lists and Libraries
	•	Jeff Case Management List (soon to be “Clarke”) tracks cases, clients, opposing counsel, and assignments.
	•	Client, Adjuster, and Opposing Counsel Lists are all housed at the hub level and referenced via lookup columns.
	•	Document Libraries within team sites store pleadings, discovery packets, orders, and deposition documents, utilizing metadata for organization.

2.3. Site Templates and Automation
	•	You created a Terry Template site and attempted to replicate its structure via PnP PowerShell.
	•	Encountered issues where the destination site is incorrectly identified as a communication site instead of a team site.
	•	Exploring Power Automate flows to automate site creation and ensure proper metadata application.

2.4. Managed Metadata & Lookup Columns
	•	You are evaluating whether to use Managed Metadata or Lookup Columns for contacts like Sun Taxi.
	•	Managed Metadata provides consistency but lacks filtering and sorting flexibility compared to Lookup Columns.
	•	Lookup Columns allow dynamic data retrieval but require maintenance at the list level.

3. Goals and Objectives

3.1. Case Management and Workflow Efficiency
	•	Ensure all new cases are registered with standardized data in Clarke (formerly Jeff list).
	•	Streamline the process of creating new team sites with predefined document libraries, metadata, and permissions.
	•	Enhance tracking of pleadings, discovery, and court orders using metadata-driven automation.

3.2. Document Management and Standardization
	•	Ensure all Word documents are updated to modern formats (no 2003 versions).
	•	Maintain three required documents per document set in specific libraries.
	•	Implement consistent metadata tagging across all document libraries.

3.3. Automation with Power Automate
	•	Automate case status tracking to notify when pleadings are filed, discovery is received, and orders are issued.
	•	Set up a flow to process assignment-related emails, creating list items and saving attachments automatically.
	•	Integrate Mark’s Outlook Calendar with Clarke to track due dates and upcoming legal tasks.

3.4. Dashboard and Reporting Enhancements
	•	Implement a SharePoint dashboard to visualize the timeline and status of each case.
	•	Track activities like discovery sent/received, pre-pleading status, and court filings.
	•	Provide Mark with a master task list that integrates with other workflows.

3.5. Custom Development (PnP, PowerShell, Python)
	•	Continue developing PnP templates to ensure team sites follow the required structure.
	•	Explore Python integration within SharePoint, possibly through Power Automate or Azure Functions.
	•	Fix issues with PowerShell profiles being stored in OneDrive, causing version conflicts.

4. Key Concerns and Challenges

4.1. Standardization vs. Flexibility
	•	How much structure should be imposed on SharePoint sites?
	•	Balance between predefined templates and ad-hoc case-specific customization.

4.2. Licensing and Cost Considerations
	•	Power Automate licensing constraints may limit desktop automation usage.
	•	SharePoint Online’s limitations on list lookup thresholds and custom scripting restrictions.

4.3. SharePoint Site Templates and PnP Issues
	•	Encountering errors when applying PnP templates, especially template mismatches.
	•	Need a consistent way to create new case sites without manual intervention.

4.4. Power Automate Integration with Outlook
	•	Preventing duplicate email-triggered list items when processing assignments.
	•	Handling email attachments efficiently without overwhelming storage quotas.

4.5. Metadata vs. Lookup Column Decision
	•	Weighing the trade-offs between Managed Metadata (taxonomy consistency) and Lookup Columns (sortable, filterable, but less scalable).

5. Limitations and Workarounds

5.1. SharePoint Online Constraints
	•	Limited scripting support → Using PnP PowerShell and Power Automate as workarounds.
	•	25,000 item threshold in lookup columns → Considering Managed Metadata where feasible.

5.2. Power Automate Licensing Constraints
	•	Cloud flows are free but desktop flows require premium licenses.
	•	Exploring Azure Functions or Python scripting for automation outside Power Automate.

5.3. Managing Legacy Documents and Compatibility
	•	Outdated Word formats (2003) → Automate file conversion via Power Automate Desktop or OneDrive actions.

5.4. Automating List Item Creation from Emails
	•	Prevent duplicate email processing by using Power Automate subject line checks.

5.5. Customizing SharePoint Navigation and Branding
	•	Workarounds for adding hub site navigation to all new sites within templates.

6. Next Steps and Strategic Recommendations
	1.	Finalize the Clarke list:
	•	Convert the Jeff list fully into Clarke with the best metadata vs. lookup balance.
	2.	Resolve PnP template application issues:
	•	Investigate the misidentified site template issue when copying team sites.
	3.	Refine Power Automate flows:
	•	Ensure case tracking, document processing, and email parsing flows are optimized.
	4.	Implement SharePoint Dashboard:
	•	Build a timeline/status view for cases, integrating Outlook and Clarke.
	5.	Evaluate Power Automate Desktop Alternatives:
	•	Determine if Python or Azure Functions can offload automation tasks to avoid licensing costs.
	6.	Ensure Consistency Across Document Sets:
	•	Use Power Automate or PnP provisioning to enforce three required documents per document set.

Final Thoughts

Your SharePoint tenant is well-structured for case management but requires fine-tuning of automation, site templates, and metadata strategy. Your next steps should focus on resolving PnP issues, optimizing Power Automate, and finalizing your dashboard.
