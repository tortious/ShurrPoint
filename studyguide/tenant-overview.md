## 1. Introduction

Your SharePoint tenant is designed to support case management, document organization, and workflow automation for a small law firm. You're leveraging SharePoint Online, Power Automate, PnP PowerShell, and other Microsoft 365 tools to create an efficient, scalable system for legal case management. The goal is to balance standardization with flexibility while optimizing automation for document and list management.

## 2. Current SharePoint Tenant Setup

### 2.1. Tenant Structure

- Hub site established for case management, with individual team sites for each case
- Lists centralized at the hub level for unified case-related data
- Libraries utilized within team sites for document management without folder dependencies

### 2.2. Lists and Libraries

- Jeff Case Management List (transitioning to "Clarke") for tracking:
  - Cases
  - Clients
  - Opposing counsel
  - Assignments
- Supporting lists at hub level:
  - Client List
  - Adjuster List
  - Opposing Counsel List
- Document Libraries in team sites for:
  - Pleadings
  - Discovery packets
  - Orders
  - Deposition documents

### 2.3. Site Templates and Automation

- Terry Template site created as reference
- PnP PowerShell replication attempts facing site type identification issues
- Exploring Power Automate for automated site creation and metadata management

### 2.4. Managed Metadata & Lookup Columns

- Evaluating options for contact management (e.g., Sun Taxi)
- Managed Metadata benefits:
  - Consistency in terminology
  - Centralized management
- Lookup Columns advantages:
  - Enhanced filtering capabilities
  - Improved sorting functionality
  - Dynamic data retrieval

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### 3.2. Document Management and Standardization

- Modernize Word documents (eliminate 2003 formats)
- Maintain document set requirements:
  - Three required documents per set
  - Consistent library organization
- Implement unified metadata tagging system

### 3.3. Automation with Power Automate

- Case status tracking automation:
  - Pleading filing notifications
  - Discovery receipt alerts
  - Order issuance updates
- Email processing automation:
  - Assignment creation
  - Attachment management
- Calendar integration:
  - Sync with Mark's Outlook
  - Due date tracking
  - Task management

### 3.4. Dashboard and Reporting Enhancements

- SharePoint dashboard implementation:
  - Case timeline visualization
  - Status tracking
  - Activity monitoring:
    - Discovery tracking
    - Pre-pleading status
    - Court filing status
- Task list integration for Mark

### 3.5. Custom Development

- PnP development focus:
  - Template refinement
  - Structure standardization
- Python integration exploration:
  - Power Automate integration
  - Azure Functions possibilities
- PowerShell profile management improvements

## 4. Key Concerns and Challenges

### 4.1. Standardization vs. Flexibility

- Balancing structured templates with customization needs
- Determining optimal level of site standardization

### 4.2. Licensing and Cost Considerations

- Power Automate licensing limitations

## 5. Limitations and Workarounds

### 5.1. SharePoint Online Constraints

- Scripting limitations:
  - Using PnP PowerShell
  - Power Automate implementations
- List threshold management:
  - 25,000 item limit
  - Metadata alternatives

### 5.2. Power Automate Licensing Constraints
