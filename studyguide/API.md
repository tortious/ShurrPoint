Below is a step-by-step guide and some best practices on how to register and protect a custom API with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and then integrate it with your SharePoint environment. Since you referenced “#3 API Registration” from our previous discussion, I’ll focus on creating a secure custom API resource that your other applications (for example, a SharePoint web part or a Power Apps portal) can call.

---

## 1. Why Register an API in Microsoft Entra ID?

When you register (or “expose”) an API in Entra ID (Azure AD), you’re telling Microsoft 365 which security principals (users or service principals) can obtain access tokens for that resource. This setup allows:

- **Secure token-based authentication** via OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect.  
- **Controlled permission assignments and scopes** (so only authorized users/apps can call your API).  
- **Centralized identity and access management** (no custom password storage or ad-hoc security logic required).

---

## 2. High-Level Steps

1. **Create (or reuse) an App Registration** in Azure AD to represent your API.  
2. **Expose the API** (define the Application ID URI and scopes).  
3. **(Optional) Add App Roles** if you need role-based authorization.  
4. **Grant permissions** to client applications that will call this API.  
5. **Implement code** in your API to validate tokens.  
6. **(Optional) Configure your API to call SharePoint** (if your API needs to read or write SharePoint data on behalf of a user or in the background).  
7. **Integrate** the client application (e.g., a SharePoint web part or Power Apps portal) to request tokens and call the API.

Below, I’ll go into more details on each step.

## 3. Detailed Walkthrough

### 3.1 Create or Identify Your API App Registration

1. **Go to the Azure Portal**  
   - In your browser, go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), then navigate to **Azure Active Directory** → **App registrations** → **New registration**.  
2. **Name the App**  
   - For example, you might call it **“Portals-Cases Dashboard API”** or **“MyCompany.Cases.API”**.  
   - Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only** if you only need single-tenant.  
3. **Redirect URI** (Optional for APIs)  
   - Typically, for a purely back-end API, you don’t need a redirect URI. You can skip that if you’re not expecting interactive logins.

Once you complete this, Azure AD gives you a **Client (Application) ID** and a **Tenant ID**. This newly registered application will represent *the protected resource (API)*.

---

### 3.2 Expose the API (Create Scopes)

After you create the app registration, you must “tell” Azure AD that this app is actually an API. You do that by exposing scopes.

1. **Application ID URI**  
   - In the **Expose an API** blade, you’ll see a field for **Application ID URI**.  
   - By default, Azure AD might create something like `api://<your-client-id>`. You can keep that or customize it (e.g., `api://mycompany.com/Portals-CasesDashboard`).  
2. **Add a Scope**  
   - Click on **Add a scope** and define at least one scope, such as `user_impersonation` or `access_as_user`.  
   - Provide an admin consent display name/description. For example:  
     - **Scope name**: `user_impersonation`  
     - **Who can consent**: Admins and users (depending on your scenario).  
     - **Admin consent display name**: *Access the Cases API as a user*  
   - Save your scope.

You now have an **API** with a scope that clients can request.

---

### 3.3 (Optional) Add App Roles

If you need more granular, role-based permissions (for example, “Case.Reader” vs “Case.Contributor”), you can define **App Roles** instead (or in addition to scopes). This allows user or app principal assignment to roles in Azure AD. However, for most scenarios, scopes suffice.

---

### 3.4 Grant Permissions to Client Apps

If you have a **separate** app registration that represents the **client** (for example, a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) web part, a custom web application, or a Power Apps Portal registration), you need to allow that client to request tokens for your new API.

1. **Open the Client App Registration**  
   - Go to **Azure Active Directory** → **App registrations**.  
   - Select your *client* application (the front end).  
2. **API Permissions** → **Add a permission** → **My APIs**  
   - Locate the newly created API registration (e.g., “Portals-Cases Dashboard API”).  
   - Select the scope you created (e.g., `user_impersonation`).  
3. **Grant Admin Consent**  
   - If the scope requires admin consent, you’ll need to click **Grant admin consent** for the tenant.  

This means your client app can now request access tokens for your API under the configured scope.

### 3.5 Implement Token Validation in Your API

Your API (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Python) must verify the inbound bearer token to ensure the call is from an authenticated and authorized source.

1. **Configure Middleware (ASP.NET Core Example)**  
   ```csharp
   public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
   {
       services.AddAuthentication(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
           .AddJwtBearer(options =>
           {
               options.Authority = $"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/v2.0";
               options.Audience = "api://<YOUR-API-CLIENT-ID-OR-URI>";
           });

       services.AddAuthorization();
       services.AddControllers();
   }

   public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
   {
       app.UseRouting();
       app.UseAuthentication();
       app.UseAuthorization();
       app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
       {
           endpoints.MapControllers();
       });
   }
   ```
   - **Authority**: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0` (or `common` if multi-tenant).  
   - **Audience**: Should match your **Application ID URI** (for example `api://<your-client-id>`).  
2. **Check Roles/Scopes in Code** (if needed)  
   - If you want to check user roles or scopes:  
     ```csharp
     [Authorize]
     [HttpGet]
     public IActionResult GetCases() 
     {
         // Only accessible if the bearer token includes the correct scope.
         return Ok(/* your data */);
     }
     ```

### 3.6 (Optional) Configure Your API to Call SharePoint

If your API itself needs to read or modify SharePoint data, you have two common approaches:

1. **On-Behalf-Of (OBO) Flow** (User Delegation)  
   - If you want your API to act on behalf of the authenticated user, you can implement the [On-Behalf-Of flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow).  
   - This requires your API to request an access token to SharePoint (or Microsoft Graph) using the user’s existing token.  
   - You must configure your API registration to allow that.  
2. **Application Permissions** (Background Daemon)  
   - If your API needs to do background tasks against SharePoint without a user context, you’d grant **Application Permissions** in Azure AD (like `Sites.ReadWrite.All`) and use client credentials.  
   - Be mindful that this typically requires **Admin consent** because it can be broad access.

For SharePoint Online (and Microsoft 365 in general), if you only need user-scoped actions, the OBO flow is more fine-grained. If you need background or service-level access, consider application permissions.

### 3.7 Consuming the API from SharePoint (Ideas)

If your end goal is to call this API from within SharePoint, here are a few patterns:

1. **SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Web Part**  
   - In an SPFx solution, you can use the `@microsoft/sp-http` library or `aadTokenProviderFactory` to acquire tokens for your **API**.  
   - You must configure the **manifest** or the **package-solution.json** with the resource (your API app registration) so SPFx knows which scope to request.  
2. **Power Apps / Power Automate**  
   - You can create a **Custom Connector** that points to your API.  
   - In the connector’s security settings, reference the Azure AD OAuth 2.0 identity, specifying the **client ID** and **resource URI**.  
   - Once the connector is deployed in your environment, you can consume it from a Power App or a Flow.  
3. **Direct JavaScript / Single-Page Application**  
   - If you just have custom JavaScript in SharePoint (e.g., a modern page with an embedded script), you’d use something like MSAL.js to authenticate and get the token, then attach the bearer token in the `Authorization` header when calling your API.

## 4. Best Practices & Tips

1. **Use Certificates for Client Credentials**  
   - If you have a daemon or background process calling the API, consider uploading a certificate rather than using a client secret. Certificates are more secure for long-lived credentials.  
2. **Set Access Policies**  
   - Consider restricting which users or groups can access the client app or the API. This can be done in **Enterprise Applications** → **User & Groups** → **Assignments**.  
3. **Monitor and Log**  
   - Use **Azure AD Sign-in logs** and **Application Insights** in your API to track usage. This helps you debug issues and see who’s calling the API.  
4. **Keep Permissions Minimal**  
   - Only request the scopes/permissions you really need. Overly broad permissions can pose security risks.  
5. **Document Your Setup**  
   - Add notes in the **App Registration** “Description” and label your scopes clearly. Future you (or other admins) will thank you!

## 5. Summary

By registering your API in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and defining proper scopes or roles, you ensure secure token-based access. Then, any client (SharePoint, Power Apps, custom apps) can request those scopes at runtime and include a valid access token when calling your API. You simply configure your API to validate those tokens and enforce the authorization logic.

- **Create an Azure AD App Registration** for the API → **Expose an API** (create scopes)  
- **Grant permissions** from the **client** app to the **API** → **Implement token validation**  
- **(Optional)** call SharePoint from your API using **on-behalf-of** or **application** permissions.

With these steps in place, you’ll have a robust, secure foundation for a “Portals-Cases Dashboard” or any other custom scenario integrating SharePoint, Power Platform, and custom APIs.
