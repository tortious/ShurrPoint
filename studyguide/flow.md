# Power Automate Best Practices for SharePoint Integration

## 1. Email-Based Flows

- **Prefer Send an Email (V2) over V3**: V2 is more compatible with Microsoft 365 Business/Exchange and supports dynamic attachments, making it more versatile for SharePoint integrations.

- **Dynamic Recipient Management**: For scenarios requiring variable recipients based on document uploads, store recipient emails in SharePoint columns for dynamic retrieval. This approach provides more flexibility and maintainability.

- **Loop Prevention**: When creating email-triggered flows that also send emails, implement safeguards to prevent infinite loops. Avoid configurations that auto-forward into monitored inboxes.

## 2. SharePoint Document Library Flows

- **Optimal Trigger Selection**: 
    - Use "When a file is created (properties only)" for immediate response without content loading
    - Combine with "Get file content" action when file attachments are needed
    - Consider versioning impact on trigger frequency

- **File Creation and Modification Handling**:
    - Implement "When a file is created or modified (properties only)" for comprehensive change tracking
    - Use conditions to filter for specific column modifications
    - Apply file type filtering through filename conditions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`)

## 3. Case Management: Jeff List Automations

- **Status Update Tracking**:
    - Monitor case progression through "When an item is modified" triggers
    - Implement Teams/email notifications for status changes
    - Configure automated deadline reminders
    - Integrate with Mark's Outlook calendar using dynamic event creation

## 4. Case Assignment Automation

- **Email-Based Assignment Processing**:
    - Configure Outlook triggers for incoming assignments
    - Implement subject line filtering for "assignment" keywords
    - Extract details for Jeff List item creation
    - Set up automatic attachment handling
    - Filter out forwarded emails using "FW" and "RE" conditions

## 5. Document Set Automations

- **New Case Document Management**:
    - Automate Document Set creation
    - Pre-populate standard templates
    - Apply metadata automatically
    - Configure intelligent file organization based on metadata

## 6. SharePoint List and Managed Metadata Integration

- **Managed Metadata Handling**:
    - Extract term labels properly in Power Automate
    - Handle lookup column expansion effectively
    - Implement additional "Get Item" actions when needed

## 7. Approval & Signature Workflows

- **Document Approval Process**:
    - Implement "Start and Wait for Approval" for draft reviews
    - Configure parallel approvals when needed
    - Integrate DocuSign/Adobe Sign for settlement agreements

## 8. Power Automate Desktop vs. Cloud Considerations

- **Platform Selection**:
    - Cloud flows are preferred for SharePoint automation
    - Reserve PAD for legacy application integration
    - Consider licensing implications

## 9. Performance and Quota Management

- **API Limit Awareness**:
    - Premium plans: 40,000 calls/day
    - Standard Microsoft 365: ~5,000 calls per user/day
    - Implement batch processing when possible
    - Monitor flow execution frequency

## 10. Advanced SharePoint Customizations

- **HTTP Request Implementation**:
    - Utilize SharePoint API calls for advanced functionality
    - Create dynamic sites through HTTP requests
    - Integrate Python scripts via Azure Functions or PAD

## Best Practice Summary

- Use Email (V2) for SharePoint & Business M365 integration
- Implement property-only triggers for efficiency
- Apply proper email trigger filtering
- Handle metadata and lookup columns appropriately
- Optimize for API limits
- Leverage HTTP requests for advanced customization
