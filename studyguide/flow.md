Since you’re heavily invested in Power Automate for SharePoint workflows, here are some important insights and best practices tailored to your needs:

1️⃣ Email-Based Flows
	•	Use “Send an Email (V2)” over (V3) → Because (V2) works with Microsoft 365 Business/Exchange and allows dynamic attachments.
	•	Dynamic recipients → If you need to send an email to different recipients based on the document uploaded, store the recipient email in a SharePoint column and pull it dynamically.
	•	Avoid Infinite Loops → If a flow triggers on an email, then sends an email, make sure you don’t trigger the same flow again (e.g., avoid auto-forwarding into the same inbox).

2️⃣ SharePoint Flows for Document Libraries
	•	Trigger: “When a file is created (properties only)”
	•	This trigger fires immediately but doesn’t pull file content.
	•	Pair it with “Get file content” to attach the document.
	•	Watch out for versioning → If versioning is enabled, updates can trigger multiple times.
	•	Trigger: “When a file is created or modified (properties only)”
	•	Use if you need to react to both uploads and edits.
	•	Tip: If tracking file changes, use a Condition to filter for specific modifications (e.g., only trigger if a “Status” column changes).
	•	Filtering Files in Triggers
	•	If you only want a flow to trigger on specific file types, add a condition checking File Name → Ends with .pdf, .docx, etc.
	•	Example: Only send emails when PDFs are uploaded.

3️⃣ Case Management: Jeff List Automations
	•	Track Case Status Updates
	•	Use the “When an item is modified” trigger on the Jeff List to detect when a case progresses.
	•	Send a Teams message or email when a case moves from “Pre-Pleading” → “Filed”.
	•	Auto-Generate Reminders for Deadlines
	•	If your Jeff List has a “Due Date” column, use a Scheduled Flow that runs daily:
	•	If Due Date = Today, send a reminder.
	•	If Due Date - 7 Days, send a “1-week warning”.
	•	Link Mark’s Outlook Calendar
	•	Power Automate can sync Jeff List dates with Mark’s Outlook using:
	•	“Create event in Outlook” action.
	•	Use dynamic values from the case entry (title, date, description).

4️⃣ Power Automate for Case Assignments
	•	Extract Assignments from Email Automatically
	•	Use a trigger for Outlook: “When an email arrives”.
	•	Condition: Check if the subject contains “assignment”.
	•	Extract details and create a new Jeff List item.
	•	Save attachments to the relevant SharePoint library.
	•	Prevent False Triggers
	•	Use a condition to ignore “FW” and “RE” emails (to avoid triggering on forwarded emails).

5️⃣ SharePoint Document Set Automations
	•	Auto-Create Required Documents in a New Case Folder
	•	When a new case site is created, use a flow to:
	•	Generate a Document Set (e.g., “Pleadings Packet”).
	•	Pre-fill it with standard templates (Complaint, Motion, etc.).
	•	Assign the right metadata (case number, client, opposing counsel).
	•	Automatically Organize Files Based on Metadata
	•	If a document is uploaded with “Discovery” in the Title, move it to a Discovery Documents folder.
	•	If it contains “Order”, move it to a Court Orders folder.

6️⃣ SharePoint List vs. Managed Metadata: Flow Implications
	•	Managed Metadata Columns in Power Automate
	•	If using Managed Metadata (e.g., for tracking case numbers or “Sun Taxi”), be aware that Power Automate doesn’t retrieve values as plain text.
	•	You’ll need to extract the Label (not just the Term ID) in expressions.
	•	Lookup Columns: Easier but Slower
	•	If using Lookup Columns (e.g., linking cases to adjusters or opposing counsel), Power Automate may struggle with expanding lookup fields.
	•	You might need an extra action (“Get Item”) to retrieve full details.

7️⃣ Approval & Signature Workflows
	•	Simple Document Approval
	•	Use “Start and Wait for Approval” → Works best when one attorney needs to approve a draft pleading or court filing before it’s finalized.
	•	Parallel Approvals
	•	If both Mark and the Attorney need to approve something before filing, use a “Parallel Approval” action.
	•	DocuSign or Adobe Sign Integration
	•	If you need signatures on settlement agreements, use the DocuSign connector in Power Automate.
	•	This sends a document directly for signature and saves the final signed copy in SharePoint.

8️⃣ Power Automate Desktop vs. Cloud
	•	Power Automate Desktop (PAD)
	•	You were considering PAD for SharePoint automation, but:
	•	PAD requires a premium license.
	•	Cloud Flows handle SharePoint actions more efficiently without needing a local machine to run.
	•	When to Use PAD
	•	If you need to interact with legacy apps that don’t have an API (e.g., a web-based case management tool).

9️⃣ Performance Optimization & Quota Limits
	•	Avoid Exceeding API Limits
	•	Each Power Automate plan has API call limits:
	•	Premium plans: 40,000 calls per day.
	•	Standard Microsoft 365: ~5,000 calls per user per day.
	•	Batch Actions When Possible → If updating multiple SharePoint items, use “Apply to Each” with concurrency enabled.
	•	Watch for Flow Runs
	•	If a flow runs too often, it can exceed the 5000 API call limit quickly.
	•	Consider trigger conditions to only fire when needed.

🔟 Advanced SharePoint Customizations
	•	HTTP Requests for Advanced Actions
	•	Since you’re interested in HTTP requests, you can skip Power Automate limitations by making SharePoint API calls inside your flows.
	•	Example:
	•	Instead of using the built-in “Create Site” action, use an HTTP request to create sites dynamically.
	•	Triggering Python Scripts from Power Automate
	•	Since you want to integrate Python, you can:
	•	Use a Power Automate button that triggers an Azure Function running your Python script.
	•	Or trigger Python via a local Power Automate Desktop flow.

Final Takeaways
	•	“Send an email (V2)” is best for SharePoint & Business M365.
	•	Use “When a file is created (properties only)” to avoid unnecessary flow triggers.
	•	Filter email-based flows to avoid duplicates and false triggers.
	•	Lookup columns & managed metadata need extra handling in Power Automate.
	•	Avoid hitting API limits by optimizing triggers & batching actions.
	•	HTTP requests unlock more SharePoint customization.
