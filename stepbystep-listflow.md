To create an automated flow that triggers when a new item is added to your JEFF list, then creates a new team site within your Case Management hub site, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

	1.	Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create sites in SharePoint and set up Power Automate flows.
	2.	Install Power Automate (if not already available in your Office 365 environment).
	3.	Access to SharePoint PnP PowerShell with proper configuration, as it can simplify working with SharePoint HTTP requests if needed.

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Set Up the Trigger in Power Automate

	1.	Open Power Automate and create a new flow.
	2.	Choose “Automated Cloud Flow” and name your flow (e.g., “Create Site on New JEFF Entry”).
	3.	Set the trigger to “When an item is created” in SharePoint.
	4.	Specify your SharePoint site where the JEFF list is located, and select the JEFF list as the list to monitor.

Step 2: Initialize Variables for Your Flow

	1.	Add an “Initialize variable” action to store the court number and define the site name.
	2.	Name the variable (e.g., CourtNumber) and set its type to String.
	3.	In the Value field, select Dynamic Content and choose the Court Number column from your JEFF list.
	4.	Add another “Initialize variable” action to store the site URL.
	•	Name it SiteURL and set its type to String.

Step 3: Format the Site Name

	1.	Add a “Compose” action to construct the site URL.
	2.	In the Inputs field, add the URL format you want, combining static parts of the URL with the court number variable. For example:

https://yourcompany.sharepoint.com/sites/case-management-{variables('CourtNumber')}

Replace yourcompany with your SharePoint domain.

Step 4: Configure the HTTP Request to Create the Site

	1.	Add an HTTP request action to communicate with SharePoint for site creation.
	2.	Set Method to POST.
	3.	In URI, enter the following endpoint:

_api/SPSiteManager/Create


	4.	Under Headers, add these:
	•	Accept with a value of application/json;odata=verbose.
	•	Content-Type with a value of application/json;odata=verbose.
	5.	Body: Use JSON to define the site properties. This can include your court number variable and predefined settings:

{
  "request": {
    "Title": "@{variables('CourtNumber')}",
    "Url": "@{outputs('Compose')}",
    "Lcid": 1033,
    "ShareByEmailEnabled": false,
    "SiteDesignId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", 
    "WebTemplate": "64",
    "Owner": "youradmin@yourcompany.com"
  }
}

	•	Replace "SiteDesignId" with your custom template’s ID (if applicable).
	•	Set "Owner" to the email of the admin or primary owner for these sites.

	6.	Add another HTTP action to register the new site under your Case Management hub. This also uses a POST method.

{
  "siteUrl": "@{outputs('Compose')}",
  "hubSiteId": "your-case-management-hub-id"
}

	•	Replace "your-case-management-hub-id" with the hub site ID for Case Management.

Step 5: Configure Error Handling and Conditionals

	•	Add error handling to ensure that any issues in site creation are logged.
	•	Optionally, add a Condition action to check if the court number already exists to avoid duplication.

Step 6: Test the Flow

	1.	Save your flow and go back to the JEFF list.
	2.	Add a new item to test if the flow triggers successfully.
	3.	Monitor Power Automate for any errors, and validate that the site has been created with the correct URL and is registered to the Case Management hub.

Step 7: Finalize Permissions and Notifications (Optional)

	1.	Set up permissions on the created sites if required.
	2.	Add a notification to alert team members about the new site.

This setup automates new site creation based on JEFF list entries and ties them directly to your Case Management hub using the court number for easy tracking. Let me know if you’d like help with specific details on any of these steps!
