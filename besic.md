## Site Design JSON File

The site design JSON references one or more site scripts. Here’s a basic outline for your site design JSON:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/sp/site-design-script-actions.schema.json",
  "id": "your-site-design-id",
  "version": 1,
  "siteScript": [
    {
      "title": "Law Firm Case Template",
      "description": "Site design for case management in SharePoint Online.",
      "siteScriptIds": [
        "your-site-script-id-1",
        "your-site-script-id-2"
      ],
      "webTemplate": "64",
      "previewImageAltText": "Law Firm Case Template",
      "isDefault": false
    }
  ]
}
