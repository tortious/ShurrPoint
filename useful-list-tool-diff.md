I built a tool to help design custom list form layouts

[https://form.challigan.com/](https://form.challigan.com/)

I made a handy little tool to help with customising SharePoint list forms using JSON. 

Hopefully someone finds this useful! 

I need to make a few layout tweaks and add colour pickers in place of the colour fields. Will add those soon. 

There's a couple other Power Automate tools linked on there too that you might find useful too.
