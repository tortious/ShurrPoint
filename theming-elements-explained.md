Understanding how JSON theme settings map to various elements in a SharePoint site can significantly aid in customizing your site’s appearance. While I can’t display images directly, I can guide you through the key JSON tokens and their corresponding site elements:
	1.	themePrimary: This sets the primary color used across the site, affecting elements like links, buttons, and highlights.
	2.	themeSecondary: This defines the secondary color, often applied to less prominent accents and some hover states.
	3.	themeTertiary: This color is used for tertiary accents, such as subtle borders or background shades.
	4.	neutralPrimary: This controls the primary text color, influencing most of the standard text throughout the site.
	5.	neutralSecondary: This sets the color for secondary text, typically used for metadata or less prominent information.
	6.	neutralTertiary: This affects tertiary text elements, like disabled text or placeholder content.
	7.	neutralLighter: This determines the background color for lighter sections, such as the site background or web part backgrounds.
	8.	neutralLight: This sets the color for slightly darker backgrounds, like section backgrounds or card backgrounds.
	9.	neutralDark: This controls the color for darker text elements, often used for headings or emphasized text.
	10.	neutralQuaternary: This affects the color of borders and separators, providing subtle distinctions between sections.
	11.	neutralQuaternaryAlt: This sets alternative border colors, offering additional contrast options.
	12.	neutralTertiaryAlt: This influences the color of icons and tertiary elements, ensuring they are distinct yet cohesive.
	13.	white: This defines the color for white elements, typically the main background color of the site.
	14.	black: This sets the color for black elements, often used for text or high-contrast features.
	15.	accent: This controls the color of accent elements, such as hyperlinks or emphasized buttons.

For a comprehensive understanding and visual representation of how these tokens map to site elements, you can refer to Microsoft’s official documentation on SharePoint site theming: ￼

Additionally, the SharePoint Theme Designer tool allows you to experiment with these tokens and see real-time previews of how changes affect your site’s appearance:
