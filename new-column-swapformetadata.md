To swap your existing “Single line of text” columns with “Managed Metadata” columns in your JEFF list, you’ll need to follow these steps:

1. Create New Managed Metadata Columns:

First, you need to create new Managed Metadata columns in your JEFF list.

	1.	Go to the JEFF list in SharePoint.
	2.	Click on Settings (gear icon) at the top right, and then select List Settings.
	3.	Under Columns, click Create column.
	4.	Name the column (e.g., the same name as the “Single line of text” column you’re replacing, but slightly different for now to avoid conflicts).
	5.	Under Column Type, select Managed Metadata.
	6.	Choose the relevant Term Set from your Term Store to connect the metadata to.
	7.	Save the column.

2. Map Data from Single Line to Managed Metadata:

You will need to move the data from your “Single line of text” column to the new “Managed Metadata” column.

	1.	Go back to your JEFF list.
	2.	Create a view that shows both the old “Single line of text” column and the new “Managed Metadata” column side by side.
	3.	You can either manually copy and paste values (if it’s a small list), or if the data is extensive, you could use Power Automate or Excel to transfer the data.

Option 1: Manual Transfer

	•	In the Quick Edit view of your list, you can copy data from the old “Single line of text” column to the new “Managed Metadata” column.

Option 2: Bulk Transfer with Excel

	•	Export the list to Excel by clicking on Export to Excel.
	•	In Excel, move the values from the “Single line of text” column to the new “Managed Metadata” column and match them to terms in your term store.
	•	Save and import the updated Excel sheet back into your SharePoint list.

Option 3: Use Power Automate to Transfer Data

	•	In Power Automate, create a flow that updates the Managed Metadata column based on the existing “Single line of text” column. You’ll need to match the text values to the corresponding metadata terms programmatically.

3. Delete the Old “Single Line of Text” Column:

Once the data has been successfully transferred to the Managed Metadata column and you’ve verified everything is correct, you can delete the old “Single line of text” column:

	1.	Go to List Settings.
	2.	Under Columns, find your old “Single line of text” column and click on it.
	3.	Scroll to the bottom and click Delete.

4. Rename the Managed Metadata Column:

Finally, rename the Managed Metadata column (if needed) to match the old “Single line of text” column’s name:

	1.	Go to List Settings.
	2.	Click on the Managed Metadata column name and change it to your preferred name.

This process will effectively swap your “Single line of text” columns with Managed Metadata, allowing you to use the richer term-based data structure across your list.
