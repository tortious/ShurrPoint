Below is a step-by-step guide that explains how to give your applications—and your case management solution—access to Microsoft Graph API permissions so you can automate site creation (e.g., SharePoint site creation) using Power Automate (Flows). This guide includes conceptual overviews, visual references (described in text form), and some example scenarios.

1. Overview

Why Microsoft Graph?

Microsoft Graph is a unified endpoint for all the key workloads in Microsoft 365: SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, etc. By giving your apps the right permissions on Microsoft Graph, they can perform various tasks automatically, such as creating SharePoint sites, managing user permissions, sending emails, and more.

Core Steps
	1.	Register your application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
	2.	Assign the required Microsoft Graph API permissions to the registered application.
	3.	Grant admin consent so your application can use those permissions in a tenant-wide manner.
	4.	Configure authentication (client secret, certificate, or other methods).
	5.	Use Power Automate (Flows) with the Azure AD app credentials to perform your desired operations—in this case, automating SharePoint site creation.

2. Application Registration in Azure AD
	1.	Navigate to the Azure AD Portal:
	•	Go to https://portal.azure.com/ and sign in with your administrator account.
	•	In the left-hand navigation bar, select Azure Active Directory.
	2.	Create a New App Registration:
	•	Under Manage, click App registrations.
	•	Click New registration at the top.
	•	Name: Enter a meaningful name for your application (e.g., “Case Management Hub App”).
	•	Supported account types: Typically, choose “Accounts in this organizational directory only” (or whichever option suits your scenario).
	•	Redirect URI (optional at this point): If you plan to authenticate using OAuth in a web or mobile scenario, you can specify the redirect URI now. Otherwise, you can set it later if needed.
	•	Click Register.
	3.	App Registration Overview:
	•	Once created, you will be taken to the Overview page.
	•	Here, note down the Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, and the Object ID if needed.
	•	You will use the Client ID and Tenant ID in your authentication flows.

|  App Registrations   | + New registration       |
|-------------------------------------------------|
|  Name:        Case Management Hub App           |
|  Supported account types:   Single tenant       |
|  Redirect URI:   https://localhost:8080         |
|-------------------------------------------------|
|           [ Register ]                          |
 -------------------------------------------------

3. Configuring API Permissions

Once your application is registered, you need to tell Azure AD what Microsoft Graph actions your application can perform. Depending on your scenario (e.g., creating SharePoint sites, listing groups), the permissions differ.
	1.	Navigate to the API Permissions page:
	•	From your newly created app’s Overview screen, select API Permissions on the left side.
	2.	Add Permissions:
	•	Click Add a permission.
	•	Choose Microsoft Graph as the API.
	•	You can then choose Delegated permissions or Application permissions.
	•	Delegated: Your app is acting on behalf of a signed-in user.
	•	Application: Your app runs as a background service or daemon without a signed-in user.
	•	For site creation automation using Power Automate, often Application permissions are needed, especially if you want the flow to run without user context. However, depending on your use case, you might choose delegated permissions.
	3.	Select Required Permissions:
	•	For creating SharePoint sites, you’ll need permissions such as Sites.ReadWrite.All or Sites.FullControl.All (depending on your scenario).
	•	If you plan to manage Microsoft 365 Groups (for Team sites), you might also need Group.ReadWrite.All.
	•	If you’re managing users, consider User.ReadWrite.All (again, only if needed).
	•	After selecting the permissions, click Add permissions.
	4.	Grant Admin Consent:
	•	Some permissions (especially Application permissions and higher-level delegated permissions) require admin consent.
	•	On the API Permissions page, you should see a Grant admin consent button (or an option to “Grant admin consent for [tenant name]”).
	•	Click it, and an admin will have to confirm.

|      -> Application permissions                                        |
|        [] Sites.ReadWrite.All                                          |
|        [] Sites.FullControl.All                                        |
|        [] Group.ReadWrite.All                                          |
|        ...                                                             |
|  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
|  [ Grant admin consent for <YourTenantName> ]                          |
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Configuring Authentication Credentials

To access Microsoft Graph from a background service or automated flow, you’ll need a client secret or certificate.
	1.	Go to Certificates & secrets:
	•	In your app registration, click Certificates & secrets in the left menu.
	2.	Create a New Client Secret (if using a secret):
	•	Under Client secrets, click New client secret.
	•	Enter a description (e.g., “ClientSecret_CaseMgt”) and choose an expiration (e.g., 6 or 12 months).
	•	Click Add.
	•	Copy the Value of the secret and store it securely. You cannot retrieve it again later.
	3.	(Optional) Upload a Certificate (if using certificate-based auth):
	•	You can also authenticate using an X.509 certificate.
	•	This is more secure in production but more complex to set up.

Important: The combination of Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret (or certificate) is what your flows or background services will use to authenticate against Azure AD and call Microsoft Graph.

5. Using Microsoft Graph in Power Automate (Flows) for Site Creation

Now that your application is configured and has permission to create or manage SharePoint sites, you can call the Microsoft Graph API within a Power Automate flow.

Option A: Use the Out-of-the-Box Power Automate Actions (SharePoint Connector)

For many use cases, you may not need custom Graph calls. Power Automate’s SharePoint connector includes actions like Create site (for Team sites) or Create list. However, these out-of-the-box actions might have limitations, and they often rely on delegated permissions under the user who triggers the flow.

Option B: Use an HTTP Action and a Custom Connector
	1.	Create or Update a Custom Connector in Power Automate:
	•	Open Power Automate and go to Data → Custom connectors → New custom connector.
	•	You can define your custom connector to call Microsoft Graph endpoints. Provide the base URL (https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/ or https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/) and set up the necessary endpoints.
	2.	Configure OAuth 2.0 Authentication using Azure AD:
	•	In the connector’s security settings, you’ll specify:
	•	Client ID (the Application ID from your registered app in Azure AD).
	•	Client Secret (the secret you generated).
	•	Authorization URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
	•	Token URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/token
	•	Scope: https://graph.microsoft.com/.default
	•	This instructs your connector to request an access token from Azure AD specifically for the Microsoft Graph (with all the permissions you previously granted in Azure AD).
	3.	Add a New Action to Call Microsoft Graph:
	•	Within the connector, define a new action (e.g., “Create SharePoint Site”) that performs a POST to the Graph endpoint for SharePoint site creation.
	•	For example:
	•	Endpoint: POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites (though typically creating a new site can be done by creating an M365 Group or using the SharePoint site creation endpoint).
	•	Body parameters might include site name, URL path, etc.
	4.	Use the Custom Connector in a Flow:
	•	In your Power Automate flow, choose + Add an action → Custom → select your custom connector action.
	•	Fill in any required parameters (site name, type of site, owners, etc.).
	•	When the flow runs, it will use the application credentials to request a token behind the scenes, then call Graph to create the site.

6. Example: Flow to Automate Site Creation via an HTTP Action

If you do not want to create a full custom connector, you could directly use Power Automate’s HTTP action.
	1.	Create a new Flow (e.g., Automated cloud flow triggered by a SharePoint list item creation).
	2.	Add a Step → HTTP action.
	3.	Configure the HTTP Action to request a token first (two-step approach):
	•	HTTP Action #1 (Token request):
	•	Method: POST
	•	URI: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/token
	•	Body (x-www-form-urlencoded):

client_id=<CLIENT_ID>
scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default
client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>
grant_type=client_credentials


	•	Parse the JSON response to extract the access_token.

	4.	HTTP Action #2 (Use the token):
	•	Method: POST
	•	URI: https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites
	•	Headers:
	•	Authorization: Bearer @{body('HTTP_Action_Token')['access_token']}
	•	Content-Type: application/json
	•	Body (for a communication site, for example):

{
  "displayName": "New Automated Site",
  "description": "Site created via Flow and Graph",
  "webUrl": "https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/newautomatedsite"
}


	•	Adjust accordingly for your desired site type (Team site vs. Communication site).

	5.	Run the Flow:
	•	When triggered, the flow will request an access token, then use that token to call Microsoft Graph’s site creation endpoint.

7. Validating and Testing
	1.	Check Azure AD Sign-Ins:
	•	In the Azure portal, go to Azure Active Directory → Monitoring → Sign-ins.
	•	Look for the sign-in activity of your registered application to ensure it’s authenticating correctly.
	2.	Check Graph Explorer (Optional):
	•	You can test some calls in Graph Explorer.
	•	Make sure to sign in with an admin account that has permissions to create sites.
	3.	Check SharePoint Admin Center:
	•	After you run a test, go to SharePoint Admin Center and see if the new site is listed.

8. Common Pitfalls & Tips
	1.	Ensure Proper Permissions:
	•	If you’re getting Access Denied errors, re-check that your app has the correct Graph permission (e.g., Sites.FullControl.All) and that you have granted admin consent.
	2.	Application vs. Delegated Permissions:
	•	For background flows (no user signing in), you generally use Application permissions. If your flows require end-user context or permissions, you might use Delegated.
	3.	Use the “.default” Scope:
	•	When requesting tokens via client credentials (application permissions), you use scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default. This instructs Azure AD to include all the application permissions your app has been granted.
	4.	Client Secret Security:
	•	Store it securely in Azure Key Vault or a secure place. Do not hard-code it in the flow.
	5.	Token Caching:
	•	Each request for a new token consumes resources. In production, you might design your solution to cache tokens, but in Power Automate that’s typically abstracted away or minimal.

	1.	A user or system triggers the flow (e.g., new case record added in a database).
	2.	The flow uses the Azure AD app (with client ID and secret) to fetch an access token.
	3.	With the token, the flow calls Microsoft Graph’s endpoint to create a new SharePoint site.
	4.	SharePoint site is created.

10. Summary

By:
	1.	Registering an application in Azure AD,
	2.	Granting it the right Microsoft Graph permissions,
	3.	Using client credentials (client ID, secret, etc.),
	4.	And building a Power Automate flow to call the Graph endpoints,

you enable automated site creation and other advanced functionalities. You can adapt these steps to other tasks across Microsoft 365 as well (such as Teams creation, mailbox manipulation, user provisioning, etc.).
