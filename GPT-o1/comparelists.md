Below is a general approach you can take to compare a list of “active sites” against a “Jeff list” in SharePoint. Since I don’t know your exact environment or how your data is stored, I’ll outline a few commonly used options. You can pick the method that makes the most sense for you:

1) Direct Comparison Within SharePoint (if both lists are in SharePoint)
	1.	Create a Combined View or Linked Data Source
	•	If both the “active sites” and the “Jeff list” are in SharePoint as separate SharePoint Lists, you can set up a lookup column or create a single list that references the other via a lookup.
	•	This involves going into List Settings > Columns > Create column and choosing Lookup as the column type, pointing to the other list.
	2.	Use Filters or Views
	•	Once you have a relationship (lookup) in place, you can create a SharePoint View that shows items from the “active sites” list that do or do not exist in the “Jeff list” (or vice versa).
	•	For instance, you can filter on the condition “Where [JeffListLookup] is equal to empty” to see which items in your active site list are not in the Jeff list.
	3.	Use Power Automate (Flow)
	•	If you need something more automated, create a Flow that runs on a schedule (or when items are created/updated). The Flow can check if a given site from “active sites” exists in the “Jeff list,” then notify you or update a comparison field.

This method keeps you working within SharePoint, but it does require you to be comfortable with lookup columns, creating custom views, or using Power Automate.

2) Export Both Lists to Excel and Compare There
	1.	Export Your SharePoint Lists to Excel
	•	Open each list in SharePoint, then go to Export to Excel (often found in the toolbar or under the SharePoint list’s Actions menu). This will download two .iqy files that open in Excel, pulling in the data from SharePoint.
	•	Alternatively, you can save them as static Excel files (CSV/XLSX).
	2.	Load into a Single Workbook
	•	In Excel, you might name one sheet “ActiveSites” and the other “JeffList.”
	•	Make sure each sheet has a common identifier column (like “Site ID” or “URL”), so that you can match entries between them.
	3.	Use VLOOKUP, XLOOKUP, or INDEX/MATCH
	•	In your “ActiveSites” sheet, create a new column “Match in JeffList?”
	•	Use a formula (for example, =XLOOKUP([@SiteID], JeffList!A:A, JeffList!A:A,“Not found”)) to see if each Site ID exists in the Jeff list. If it’s not found, Excel will return “Not found,” or you can customize a message.
	•	Alternatively, use VLOOKUP or INDEX/MATCH if you’re more familiar with those.
	4.	Filter or Conditional Formatting
	•	Once you have the formulas, you can filter all rows where the result is “Not found” to see which active sites are missing in Jeff’s list (or highlight them with conditional formatting).

This Excel-based approach is often the fastest if you’re comfortable with spreadsheet tools.

3) Use Power Query (in Excel) for a More Automated Process

If you have to do this comparison frequently, Power Query in Excel (often called “Get & Transform Data” in newer versions) can streamline the process:
	1.	Connect to SharePoint Lists
	•	In Excel, go to Data > Get Data > From Online Services > From SharePoint Online List (or from “Other Sources” if you’re on an older Excel).
	•	Enter the URL of your SharePoint site and select the lists you want (the “Jeff list” and the “active sites” list).
	2.	Merge Queries
	•	In the Power Query Editor, you can use the Merge Queries feature to compare the two lists on a key field (e.g., “SiteID”).
	•	Configure whether you want an Inner Join (only matching), Left Join (everything in the first list plus matches), etc. This will create a combined table that shows which items line up and which do not.
	3.	Load the Results
	•	Once Power Query has merged or appended the data, you can load the final table into Excel as a standard worksheet.
	•	If needed, apply filters or add columns to mark which sites exist in both lists or only in one list.
	4.	Refresh with One Click
	•	Next time you want to update the comparison, just click Refresh on the Power Query table. Excel will pull the latest from SharePoint automatically.

4) Use Power BI (if you have reporting/dashboard needs)

If you want to display results on dashboards or share visual comparisons across a team, Power BI can also connect to SharePoint lists. The steps are similar to Power Query:
	1.	Get Data from SharePoint Online Lists.
	2.	Merge or Append queries in the Power Query editor within Power BI.
	3.	Build visuals or table comparisons to highlight which sites are missing or which ones match.
	4.	Publish the report to the Power BI service so others can view it.

Key Points to Keep in Mind
	•	Identify a Unique Key: You’ll need at least one column that uniquely identifies a site (for instance, “Site ID,” “Site URL,” etc.). The comparison logic relies on this being consistent between the two data sources.
	•	Data Refresh / Updates: Decide if this is a one-time comparison or a recurring process. If it’s recurring, setting up Power Query or Power Automate to handle it repeatedly will save a lot of manual effort.
	•	Permissions: Make sure you have permission to view/export data from the SharePoint lists. If needed, coordinate with the list owners or your SharePoint admin.

Summary

To compare “active sites” against a “Jeff list” in SharePoint, you can either (1) create a lookup column and custom views in SharePoint, (2) export both lists to Excel and do a quick formula-based comparison, (3) use Power Query in Excel to merge and automatically refresh comparisons, or (4) use Power BI if you need a more advanced reporting solution.

Which route you choose depends on whether you need an ongoing automated comparison (Power Query/Power Automate/Power BI) or a quick, one-off check (Excel formulas). If you are new to SharePoint/Excel, the simplest route to start with is probably the Excel export + VLOOKUP / XLOOKUP method.
