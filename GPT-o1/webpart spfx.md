Below is a step-by-step, in-depth guide on how to create a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Web Part using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), starting from the point where you already have a generated folder structure (such as that created by the Yeoman generator for SharePoint).

1. Prerequisites Recap

Even though your folder structure is already created, make sure the following prerequisites are met:
	1.	Node.js (LTS version): Typically SPFx aligns with an LTS version of Node.js, such as Node 14 or 16 (depending on your SPFx version).
	2.	Gulp CLI: SPFx uses Gulp for tasks like building and bundling.

npm install gulp -g


	3.	Yeoman and the SharePoint Framework Yeoman Generator: Usually used to generate a project, but you might already have this done.

npm install yo @microsoft/generator-sharepoint -g


	4.	VS Code: Already installed.

You’ve mentioned that the folder structure has already been created for you, so let’s assume you’ve run something similar to:

yo @microsoft/sharepoint

… and selected the appropriate web part options. We’ll focus on what’s inside the project structure and how to use VS Code to develop, build, and test your web part.

2. Typical SPFx Folder Structure

Inside your project, you’ll see a structure similar to this (simplified):

my-spfx-solution
│
├─ .editorconfig
├─ .gitignore
├─ gulpfile.js
├─ package.json
├─ README.md
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ yarn.lock / package-lock.json
│
├─ config
│   ├─ serve.json
│   ├─ write-manifests.json
│   └─ package-solution.json
│
├─ sharepoint
│   └─ solution
│       └─ my-spfx-solution.sppkg
│
├─ src
│   ├─ webparts
│   │   └─ helloWorld
│   │       ├─ HelloWorldWebPart.manifest.json
│   │       ├─ HelloWorldWebPart.module.scss
│   │       ├─ HelloWorldWebPart.ts
│   │       └─ components
│   │           ├─ HelloWorld.tsx
│   │           └─ IHelloWorldProps.ts
│   └─ otherFolders...
│
├─ node_modules
└─ ...

Your actual folder names might differ, but the pattern is usually similar:
	•	src/webparts/... holds the source code for your web part(s).
	•	config/ holds configuration files for bundling, serving, packaging, etc.
	•	sharepoint/solution/ is where the final .sppkg file is generated for deployment.

3. Opening the Project in VS Code
	1.	Open VS Code.
	2.	Open Folder: From the menu, choose File > Open Folder, then select your project folder (my-spfx-solution).
	3.	Once opened, you’ll see the entire structure in the Explorer panel on the left.

Example Visual (ASCII-style):

Explorer
├─ .editorconfig
├─ .gitignore
├─ gulpfile.js
├─ package.json
├─ tsconfig.json
├─ config
│   ├─ serve.json
│   ├─ write-manifests.json
│   └─ package-solution.json
├─ sharepoint
│   └─ solution
│       └─ my-spfx-solution.sppkg
├─ src
│   ├─ webparts
│   │   └─ helloWorld
│   │       ├─ HelloWorldWebPart.manifest.json
│   │       ├─ HelloWorldWebPart.module.scss
│   │       ├─ HelloWorldWebPart.ts
│   │       └─ components
│   │           ├─ HelloWorld.tsx
│   │           └─ IHelloWorldProps.ts
└─ node_modules

4. Understanding the Main Files

4.1. HelloWorldWebPart.ts

This is the entry point for your SPFx web part. It extends BaseClientSideWebPart (from @microsoft/sp-webpart-base) and includes core methods like render() and getPropertyPaneConfiguration().

A simplified example:

import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDom from 'react-dom';
import { BaseClientSideWebPart } from '@microsoft/sp-webpart-base';

import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld';
import { IHelloWorldProps } from './components/IHelloWorldProps';

export interface IHelloWorldWebPartProps {
  description: string;
}

export default class HelloWorldWebPart extends BaseClientSideWebPart<IHelloWorldWebPartProps> {

  public render(): void {
    const element: React.ReactElement<IHelloWorldProps> = React.createElement(
      HelloWorld,
      {
        description: this.properties.description
      }
    );

    ReactDom.render(element, this.domElement);
  }

  protected getPropertyPaneConfiguration(): IPropertyPaneConfiguration {
    return {
      pages: [
        {
          header: { description: "Configure Web Part Properties" },
          groups: [
            {
              groupName: "Basic Settings",
              groupFields: [
                PropertyPaneTextField('description', {
                  label: "Description"
                })
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    };
  }
}

4.2. components/HelloWorld.tsx

This is a React component (if you chose React for your SPFx web part). It handles the rendering logic of your web part’s UI.

Example:

import * as React from 'react';
import styles from './HelloWorldWebPart.module.scss';
import { IHelloWorldProps } from './IHelloWorldProps';

const HelloWorld: React.FC<IHelloWorldProps> = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.helloWorld}>
      <h2>Hello SharePoint!</h2>
      <p>Description: {props.description}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default HelloWorld;

4.3. HelloWorldWebPart.module.scss

Contains your web part’s scoped CSS styles (using SASS). For example:

.helloWorld {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  padding: 10px;
}

5. Developing & Debugging the Web Part Locally
	1.	Install Dependencies
Inside your project folder, run:

npm install

or

yarn install

This ensures all packages in package.json are installed.

	2.	Local Workbench
	•	In your terminal inside VS Code (View > Terminal), run:

gulp serve


	•	This spins up a local server. Your browser should open automatically to the SharePoint local workbench (https://localhost:4321/temp/workbench.html).
	•	You can add your web part here in the local workbench to test basic functionality.

	3.	SharePoint Online Workbench
	•	If you want to test in a real SharePoint environment, go to <YourTenant>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx.
	•	By default, your web part is served from your localhost if you’re running gulp serve.

6. Common Gulp Tasks
	•	gulp serve: Serves the web part in the local or online workbench for debugging.
	•	gulp build: Builds the solution without creating packaging assets.
	•	gulp bundle --ship: Prepares an optimized production bundle.
	•	gulp package-solution --ship: Creates the .sppkg file for deployment in the sharepoint/solution folder.

Example usage:

gulp build
gulp bundle --ship
gulp package-solution --ship

7. Packaging & Deploying the Web Part

After completing development and testing:
	1.	Bundle for Production

gulp bundle --ship


	2.	Package the Solution

gulp package-solution --ship


	3.	Locate the Package
	•	By default, the solution .sppkg file will be under:

sharepoint/solution/my-spfx-solution.sppkg


	4.	Upload to App Catalog
	•	Go to your SharePoint tenant’s App Catalog: https://<YourTenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/appcatalog/.
	•	Select Apps for SharePoint in the left navigation.
	•	Upload the .sppkg file; check the “Make this solution available to all sites” if desired.
	5.	Add/Install the App to a Site
	•	Go to the Site Contents of the site where you want to add the web part.
	•	Click New > App, locate your app (the newly uploaded SPFx package), and add it.
	•	Now your web part is available to add to modern pages within that site.

8. Visualizing & Editing in VS Code
	•	IntelliSense: As you type in .ts/.tsx files, VS Code provides suggestions for imports, methods, and properties.
	•	Live Debugging: Put breakpoints in your .ts/.tsx files (by clicking in the gutter on a line number). When you run gulp serve, you can use the Developer Tools in your browser (F12) to see console logs and step through code if you attach the debugger properly (VS Code + Chrome Debug extension or Edge Tools).
	•	Search: Use Cmd+Shift+F (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+F (Windows) to search entire codebase.
	•	Source Control: If you’re using Git, the Source Control tab (left panel) tracks changes; you can commit and push changes to your repository from within VS Code.

9. Example Changes & Quick Demo

9.1. Modify the Text in HelloWorld.tsx

Let’s say we want to rename the heading from “Hello SharePoint!” to “My Custom Web Part”.
	1.	Open src/webparts/helloWorld/components/HelloWorld.tsx.
	2.	Change the <h2>Hello SharePoint!</h2> line:

<h2>My Custom Web Part</h2>


	3.	Save.

9.2. Check in Local Workbench
	1.	Terminal: gulp serve.
	2.	Browser automatically opens the local workbench: https://localhost:4321/temp/workbench.html.
	3.	Add the “HelloWorld” web part to see your new heading.

10. Tips & Best Practices
	1.	Version Control: Use Git or a similar system. Commit frequently.
	2.	Use SASS for styling: Each web part has its own .module.scss file for scoped styling. This avoids style collisions across web parts.
	3.	Property Pane: Configure custom properties for your web part in the getPropertyPaneConfiguration() method. This is how end users can customize behavior or text in your web part.
	4.	Use React Best Practices: If you’re building with React, keep components modular, pass data via props, and manage state responsibly.
	5.	Performance: For production, always run gulp bundle --ship and gulp package-solution --ship to produce optimized builds.
	6.	Upgrade SPFx: Keep track of SPFx version updates. Some Node.js or TypeScript versions may change the process. Always consult the official Microsoft docs for the latest guidelines.

Putting It All Together

By following these steps in VS Code, you can:
	1.	Open the generated SPFx solution folder.
	2.	Review the folder structure and become familiar with HelloWorldWebPart.ts, components/HelloWorld.tsx, and the .module.scss files.
	3.	Install all dependencies (via npm install or yarn install).
	4.	Serve the web part locally with gulp serve and test in the local or online workbench.
	5.	Build, bundle, and package with gulp build, gulp bundle --ship, and gulp package-solution --ship.
	6.	Deploy your .sppkg file to the App Catalog and add it to your SharePoint site.

From there, you have a fully functioning, customized SPFx web part ready for your modern SharePoint pages.

Final Note

SharePoint Framework is continually evolving. Always verify that the versions of Node.js, the SPFx generator, and your dependencies match recommended guidelines for your target SharePoint environment. By using Visual Studio Code, you’ll have a streamlined and intuitive development environment to build and debug your SharePoint web parts.

Good luck with your SharePoint web part development!
