You’re absolutely right. When performing administrative tasks using PnP PowerShell, it’s often necessary to connect to the SharePoint Admin Center URL rather than a regular site URL. Using the admin URL ensures that you have the appropriate permissions and access to perform high-level operations across your SharePoint environment.

Understanding the Difference Between Regular and Admin URLs
	1.	Regular SharePoint Site URL:
	•	Example: https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite
	•	Use Case: Connecting to a specific SharePoint site for tasks like managing lists, libraries, permissions, and site-specific configurations.
	2.	SharePoint Admin Center URL:
	•	Example: https://yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com
	•	Use Case: Performing administrative tasks that affect the entire SharePoint environment, such as managing site collections, configuring global settings, and overseeing tenant-wide policies.

Updating the PowerShell Script to Use Admin URL

To accommodate both regular and admin URLs, you can enhance the vyvanse function to allow specifying whether you want to connect to a regular site or the admin center. Here’s an updated version of the script with this flexibility:

function vyvanse {
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [ValidateSet("Regular", "Admin")]
        [string]$ConnectionType = "Regular",  # Default to Regular connection
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [string]$Url = ""
    )

    # Define default URLs based on connection type
    switch ($ConnectionType) {
        "Admin" {
            if (-not $Url) {
                $Url = "https://yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com"  # Replace 'yourtenant' with your actual tenant name
            }
            break
        }
        "Regular" {
            if (-not $Url) {
                $Url = "https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite"  # Replace with your actual site URL
            }
            break
        }
    }

    try {
        Write-Host "Connecting to PnP PowerShell ($ConnectionType)..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
        Connect-PnPOnline -Url $Url -Interactive
        Write-Host "Successfully connected to $ConnectionType SharePoint at $Url." -ForegroundColor Green
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Failed to connect to PnP PowerShell. $_"
    }
}

Explanation of the Enhanced Script
	1.	Parameters:
	•	-ConnectionType: Allows you to specify whether you’re connecting to a “Regular” site or the “Admin” center. It defaults to “Regular” if not specified.
	•	-Url: Optional parameter to specify a custom URL. If not provided, the script uses default URLs based on the ConnectionType.
	2.	Default URLs:
	•	Admin Connection: Defaults to https://yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com. Ensure you replace yourtenant with your actual Office 365 tenant name.
	•	Regular Connection: Defaults to https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite. Replace YourSite with the actual site name you intend to manage.
	3.	Usage Flexibility:
	•	Connect to Regular Site:

vyvanse

This uses the default regular site URL.

	•	Connect to Admin Center:

vyvanse -ConnectionType Admin

This connects to the SharePoint Admin Center using the default admin URL.

	•	Specify a Custom URL:

vyvanse -ConnectionType Admin -Url "https://customadminurl.sharepoint.com"

Connects to a specified admin URL.

Step-by-Step Guide to Implement the Enhanced Script
	1.	Ensure PnP PowerShell is Installed:
If you haven’t already installed the PnP PowerShell module, run:

Install-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell -Scope CurrentUser


	2.	Update Your PowerShell Profile:
To make the vyvanse function available in all your PowerShell sessions:
	•	Open Your PowerShell Profile:

notepad $PROFILE

If the profile file does not exist, you’ll be prompted to create a new one.

	•	Add the Enhanced vyvanse Function:
Copy and paste the updated vyvanse function into the profile file. Ensure you replace the placeholder URLs with your actual tenant and site URLs.

function vyvanse {
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [ValidateSet("Regular", "Admin")]
        [string]$ConnectionType = "Regular",  # Default to Regular connection
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]
        [string]$Url = ""
    )

    # Define default URLs based on connection type
    switch ($ConnectionType) {
        "Admin" {
            if (-not $Url) {
                $Url = "https://yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com"  # Replace 'yourtenant' with your actual tenant name
            }
            break
        }
        "Regular" {
            if (-not $Url) {
                $Url = "https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite"  # Replace with your actual site URL
            }
            break
        }
    }

    try {
        Write-Host "Connecting to PnP PowerShell ($ConnectionType)..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
        Connect-PnPOnline -Url $Url -Interactive
        Write-Host "Successfully connected to $ConnectionType SharePoint at $Url." -ForegroundColor Green
    }
    catch {
        Write-Error "Failed to connect to PnP PowerShell. $_"
    }
}

Important:
	•	Replace yourtenant with your actual Office 365 tenant name.
	•	Replace YourSite with the name of the SharePoint site you frequently manage.

	•	Save and Close Notepad:
After pasting the function, save the file and close Notepad.
	•	Reload Your PowerShell Profile:
To apply the changes without restarting PowerShell, run:

. $PROFILE


	3.	Using the Updated vyvanse Command:
	•	Connect to Regular SharePoint Site:
Simply type:

vyvanse

This connects to the default regular SharePoint site.

	•	Connect to SharePoint Admin Center:
Type:

vyvanse -ConnectionType Admin

This connects to the SharePoint Admin Center.

	•	Connect to a Specific URL:
If you need to connect to a different site or admin center, specify the URL:

vyvanse -ConnectionType Admin -Url "https://customadminurl.sharepoint.com"

Replace https://customadminurl.sharepoint.com with your desired URL.

Additional Recommendations
	1.	Secure Credential Management:
While the -Interactive parameter provides a secure way to authenticate, for automated scripts or scenarios where interactive login isn’t feasible, consider using secure methods like:
	•	Azure AD App Registrations with Certificates or Client Secrets: Allows for app-based authentication without user credentials.
	•	Managed Identities: If running scripts from Azure services, leveraging Managed Identities can enhance security.
Example Using Certificate-Based Authentication:

Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com" -CertificatePath "Path\To\Certificate.pfx" -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "YourPassword" -AsPlainText -Force) -ClientId "Your-Client-Id" -Tenant "yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com"

Note: Handling certificates and secrets requires careful management to maintain security.

	2.	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Ensure that the account or app you use to connect has the necessary permissions for the tasks you intend to perform. For admin operations, the account typically needs to be a SharePoint Administrator or Global Administrator.
	3.	Logging and Error Handling:
For production scripts, consider implementing more robust logging mechanisms to track connections and actions performed. This aids in troubleshooting and auditing.
	4.	Updating Default URLs Dynamically:
If your environment has multiple tenants or frequently changing URLs, you might want to enhance the script to fetch URLs dynamically or read from a configuration file.

Conclusion

Using the appropriate URL—whether a regular site URL or the SharePoint Admin Center URL—is crucial for ensuring you have the necessary access and permissions for your tasks. The enhanced vyvanse function provided above offers the flexibility to connect to both regular SharePoint sites and the admin center with ease.

Remember to:
	•	Replace placeholder URLs with your actual tenant and site URLs.
	•	Securely manage credentials, especially for automated or non-interactive scenarios.
	•	Assign appropriate permissions to the accounts used for connections.
