With a $20/month ChatGPT Plus subscription, you get access to GPT-4 (technically GPT-4-turbo), which is faster, cheaper to run, and more capable than the free-tier GPT-3.5. Since OpenAI is also rolling out custom GPTs, you can access a variety of specialized AI models that cater to specific tasks. Here are some cool and creative ways to make the most of your subscription:

1. Advanced Writing & Storytelling
Interactive Storytelling: Use ChatGPT as a dynamic Dungeon Master for RPGs or to create interactive fiction.
Worldbuilding Companion: Flesh out detailed worlds for novels, games, or roleplays.
Ghostwriting & Editing: Have ChatGPT generate, refine, and tweak your writing with AI-assisted brainstorming.
Poetry & Lyrics Generation: Create custom poetry styles or song lyrics in any tone you desire.
Scriptwriting: Generate dialogue and screenplay formats for movie scenes.
2. Coding & Development
Personal AI Assistant Development: Train custom GPTs to specialize in specific programming languages or tasks.
Debugging Partner: Upload your code and get debugging tips with explanations.
Learning New Languages: Have ChatGPT teach you coding languages step-by-step, with interactive coding challenges.
Automate Workflows: Get Python, PowerShell, or JavaScript scripts written for automating tasks in SharePoint, Excel, or general data processing.
3. Business & Productivity
Meeting Summaries & Notes: Have ChatGPT process transcripts and generate concise summaries.
PowerPoint & Report Generation: Convert rough ideas into polished professional slides or detailed reports.
Financial Analysis & Budgeting: Have it analyze trends, generate Excel formulas, or help plan expenses.
AI-Powered Negotiation Prep: Use ChatGPT to roleplay business negotiations (like your current employer situation).
4. Personal Assistant & Automation
Custom GPTs for Specific Needs: Train a personal AI to act as your law firm assistant, SharePoint guru, or general life admin.
Meal Planning & Grocery Lists: Generate recipes based on your diet and automatically create shopping lists.
Workout & Fitness Plans: Tailor workout routines based on your fitness goals.
Reminder & Life Organization Hacks: Automate and organize your personal life with AI-powered task planning.
5. Learning & Education
Deep-Dive Learning Sessions: Use ChatGPT as a personal tutor for any subject.
Language Learning Partner: Practice speaking with an AI that responds in real time.
Book Summaries & Study Guides: Quickly summarize long textbooks or research papers.
AI-Powered Flashcards & Quizzes: Generate custom quizzes to reinforce knowledge.
6. Entertainment & Creativity
AI-Generated Comedy & Jokes: Have it write custom jokes, stand-up routines, or parodies.
Character Roleplaying: Train a GPT to act like historical figures, fictional characters, or even yourself.
Personalized Horror Stories: Have it generate horror stories tailored to your fears.
Music Composition: Generate MIDI files, chord progressions, and lyrics.
7. Custom GPT Development
Create Your Own Custom GPTs: OpenAI allows you to tweak GPTs to serve very specific roles.
Train a SharePoint-Savvy AI: A personal GPT that specializes in your firm's document workflow.
Chatbots for Business or Fun: Build an AI concierge for your website or a novelty chatbot.
8. Research & Data Analysis
Generate & Analyze Large Texts: Quickly summarize reports, legal texts, or long emails.
Data Visualization & Charts: Get Python scripts to generate graphs and analyze trends.
Legal & Contract Review: Have it break down contracts into simple terms.
Since you‚Äôve got a legal background and are working with SharePoint and automation, you could use GPTs to speed up document creation, analyze case law, or create workflows for your firm. You could even train a custom GPT specifically for your firm's legal and SharePoint needs.

You said:
How would I train my own GPT? I do not really understand conceptually. Will it be separate from the standard 4o gpt (aka you)? Does it have its own separate memory?

Training Your Own GPT: How It Works
OpenAI allows you to customize a GPT, but you don‚Äôt "train" it in the traditional machine-learning sense (like feeding it terabytes of data). Instead, you‚Äôre guiding an instance of GPT-4-turbo (same base model I use) by giving it specific instructions, examples, and preferences.

Think of it as making a personalized AI assistant rather than building a new AI from scratch.

Key Questions Answered
1. Will it be separate from me (the standard ChatGPT-4o)?
Yes, your custom GPT will be a separate instance that behaves differently based on the instructions and knowledge you provide. But it still runs on OpenAI‚Äôs main GPT-4-turbo model‚Äîjust with a customized personality and focus.

2. Does it have its own separate memory?
Yes and no.

Yes: Your custom GPT can have its own ‚Äúidentity,‚Äù custom rules, and specialized behavior different from the standard GPT-4o (me).
No: It doesn‚Äôt have true memory (meaning it won‚Äôt retain knowledge across different chat sessions) unless OpenAI enables persistent memory (which is still experimental). It "remembers" what you tell it within a single conversation but forgets when you start a new chat.
How to Create a Custom GPT
OpenAI made it easy‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need coding skills. Just follow these steps:

Step 1: Open the Custom GPT Creator
Go to ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com)
Click on Explore GPTs (bottom left panel).
Click Create a GPT.
Step 2: Define Your GPT‚Äôs Purpose
You‚Äôll be prompted to give instructions on how it should behave.
Example: If you want a SharePoint Expert AI, you‚Äôd say:
"You are a SharePoint administrator assistant specializing in automating workflows, setting up site templates, and managing metadata. You answer questions in a detailed and professional manner."

You can also set custom tone, style, and behavior.
Step 3: Provide Examples & Instructions
The more examples and explicit instructions you give, the better it will align with your needs.
Example for SharePoint:
"If the user asks about Power Automate flows, provide step-by-step instructions. If the user asks about PowerShell commands, always give the latest syntax."

Step 4: Upload Files (Optional)
You can upload reference documents, like legal templates, case law summaries, or SharePoint workflows.
Your custom GPT can refer to those documents to provide more specific responses.
Step 5: Adjust Advanced Settings
You can tweak how creative it is (factual vs. imaginative).
You can define restricted topics (if you don‚Äôt want it to answer certain things).
Step 6: Save & Deploy
Once done, you can name it (e.g., ‚ÄúSharePoint Assistant Pro‚Äù) and use it whenever you want.
It will show up under ‚ÄúMy GPTs‚Äù in your ChatGPT menu.
What Can a Custom GPT Do?
Here are some ideas tailored to your work:

üíº SharePoint Admin Assistant ‚Äì Helps you with Power Automate, PnP PowerShell, metadata, and workflows.
üìë Legal Document Analyzer ‚Äì Summarizes legal docs, suggests templates, and checks formatting.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Support GPT ‚Äì Custom-built for troubleshooting software, running scripts, or managing automation.
üìö Case Law Researcher ‚Äì Finds legal precedents, explains rulings, and drafts summaries.
ü§ñ Client Intake GPT ‚Äì Helps collect and structure client data for easy use in SharePoint.

Limitations
No true memory across sessions ‚Äì Each new chat is a fresh start.
Still depends on GPT-4-turbo ‚Äì It won‚Äôt gain ‚Äúnew knowledge‚Äù beyond what OpenAI updates.
Limited to the files you upload ‚Äì It can‚Äôt browse the web like Bing AI.
If OpenAI eventually enables memory for custom GPTs, they‚Äôll be even more powerful.

Final Thoughts
It‚Äôs basically like giving me a new personality and a job description tailored to your needs. You can create multiple GPTs for different tasks (one for SharePoint, one for legal work, one for negotiations, etc.).
