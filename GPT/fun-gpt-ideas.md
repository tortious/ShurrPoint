## **How to Train Your Own Custom GPT**

### **Key Concept: You Don't "Train" It, You Customize It**
You **don’t train** a Custom GPT like a machine learning model. Instead, you **guide** an instance of GPT-4-turbo with:
- **Custom instructions**
- **Examples**
- **Uploaded files**
- **Behavioral preferences**

Think of it as **building a personal AI assistant** rather than programming a new AI from scratch.

---

## **Key Questions Answered**

### **1. Will My Custom GPT Be Separate from Standard ChatGPT-4o?**
✅ **Yes.** Your Custom GPT will be a **separate instance** with its own behavior.
❌ **But it still uses GPT-4-turbo**—not a new AI model.

### **2. Does It Have Separate Memory?**
✔️ **Yes:** It has its own "identity," rules, and behavior.
❌ **No:** It **forgets** after each session unless OpenAI enables persistent memory (which is experimental).

## **Step-by-Step Guide: How to Create a Custom GPT**

### **Step 1: Open the Custom GPT Creator**
1. Go to **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)**
2. Click **Explore GPTs** (bottom left panel)
3. Click **Create a GPT**

### **Step 2: Define Your GPT’s Purpose**
- Example: SharePoint Expert AI
  ```
  You are a SharePoint administrator assistant specializing in automating workflows, setting up site templates, and managing metadata.
  ```
- You can also set **tone, personality, and restrictions**.

### **Step 3: Provide Examples & Instructions**
- The more **examples** you provide, the better the responses.
- Example for SharePoint:
  ```
  If the user asks about Power Automate, provide step-by-step instructions.
  If the user asks about PowerShell, always give the latest syntax.
  ```

### **Step 4: Upload Files (Optional)**
- Upload **legal templates, case law, SharePoint workflows** for reference.

### **Step 5: Adjust Advanced Settings**
- Modify:
  - **Creativity Level** (Factual vs. Imaginative)
  - **Restricted Topics**

### **Step 6: Save & Deploy**
- Name it (e.g., **“SharePoint Assistant Pro”**)
- It will appear in **“My GPTs”** under your ChatGPT menu.

## **What Can a Custom GPT Do?**

### 🏛️ **Legal & Business Use Cases**
- **SharePoint Admin Assistant** – Automates **Power Automate workflows, PnP PowerShell, and metadata**.
- **Legal Document Analyzer** – Summarizes legal docs, checks formatting.
- **Tech Support GPT** – Troubleshoots **software, scripts, or automation**.
- **Case Law Researcher** – Finds legal precedents, explains rulings.
- **Client Intake GPT** – Organizes client data **for SharePoint integration**.

---

## **Limitations of Custom GPTs**
❌ **No long-term memory** (forgets between sessions)
❌ **Depends on OpenAI's model updates** (not self-learning)
❌ **Limited to uploaded files** (no live web browsing)

If OpenAI **enables memory for custom GPTs**, they will become much more powerful.

---

## **Final Thoughts**
Creating a Custom GPT is like **giving GPT-4-turbo a job description**. You can make multiple GPTs—one for **SharePoint, one for legal work, one for negotiations, etc.**
