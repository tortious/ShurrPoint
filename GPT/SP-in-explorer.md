## How to Add SharePoint to File Explorer? Quick Steps!

**October 10, 2024** by Salaudeen Rajack

### Requirement
Create a Quick Access Link to SharePoint Online in Windows Explorer.

### How to Add a SharePoint Document Library to File Explorer?
1. Browse to the specific SharePoint site and open your SharePoint Online document library or existing folder in Internet Explorer/Edge/Google Chrome.
2. From the “Views” drop-down, click on the “View in File Explorer” option.
3. Right-click “Quick Access” on the file explorer and choose “Pin current folder to Quick Access” to add a shortcut.

### Why Add SharePoint to File Explorer?
- **Familiarity**: Many users are more comfortable working in File Explorer than in a web browser.
- **Convenience**: Accessing SharePoint files through File Explorer saves time and effort.
- **Improved Performance**: Accessing files through File Explorer typically results in faster performance compared to accessing them through a web browser.
- **Integration with local apps**: Easily open SharePoint files with your preferred desktop applications.
- **Simplified file management**: Manage your files using familiar File Explorer features like drag-and-drop, copy/paste, and right-click context menus.

### Pin to Quick Access in Windows 10 / 11
1. Open the SharePoint Document library or Folder in File Explorer using the “View in File Explorer” option.
2. Click on the options button (three little dots on the toolbar) and select “Pin to Quick access.”

### Remove the SharePoint folder from the File Explorer
1. Open File Explorer and navigate to the SharePoint folder you have pinned.
2. Right-click on the folder and select “Unpin from Quick Access” from the context menu.

### Sync Vs. File Explorer
- **Sync**: Recommended for better, faster, and more reliable reasons.
- **File Explorer**: May lose versioning information, permissions, and metadata when copying files.

### Troubleshooting Checklist for common issues
- Check internet connectivity.
- Verify SharePoint URL.
- Check user permissions.
- Clear browser cache and cookies.
- Use the correct authentication method.
- Disable proxy settings.
- Check antivirus and firewall settings.
- Check the WebClient service.
- Use a different browser.
- Check Browser Settings.

### Conclusion
Adding SharePoint to File Explorer is a great way to streamline your workflow and make it easier to access and manage your files.
