Yes, you can efficiently manage each case as its own site while addressing concerns about data overload and maintainability. The key is to leverage SharePoint hub sites, content roll-ups, site templates, and automation tools to keep everything organized. Here’s how you can achieve this:

1. Centralize Case Sites Under a Hub Site

	•	Hub Site: Keep your existing “Case Management” hub site as the parent for all individual case sites. Hub sites allow for a unified navigation experience, search capabilities, and content aggregation across associated case sites.

	•	Site Association: Ensure each case site is associated with the “Case Management” hub site. This association enables centralized search and roll-up content, providing a comprehensive view of all matters.

3. Use Site Templates for Consistent Structure

	•	Site Design & Site Scripts: Create a Site Design in SharePoint that defines the standard structure for each new case site. This template can include:

	•	Document libraries (e.g., “Case Documents,” “Correspondence”)

	•	Lists (e.g., “Case Details,” “Tasks,” “Notes”)

	•	Pages (e.g., a home page summarizing key case information)

	•	Apply this template whenever a new case site is created to ensure a consistent layout and functionality across all sites.

5. Automate Site Creation and Management with Power Automate

	•	Use Power Automate to create new case sites and apply the site template:

	•	When a new case is added to your centralized list in the hub site, trigger a Power Automate flow.

	•	The flow can create a new site using the specified site template, set up initial lists and libraries, and add relevant metadata.

	•	Optionally, the flow can create links back to the centralized list for cross-referencing.

7. Centralize Data Using Content Rollup

	•	Highlighted Content Web Part: On the hub site, use the Highlighted Content web part to roll up documents, tasks, and other information from all case sites. Configure it to:

	•	Display content based on metadata (e.g., “Matter Status” or “Case Type”).

	•	Filter and sort content to show the latest or most relevant information.

	•	Custom List Rollup: Create a custom list on the hub site that aggregates key data (e.g., status, deadlines) from each case site using the List Web Part. Use Power Automate to update this central list with metadata from each case site.


9. Leverage Hub Site Search for Cross-Site Information

	•	Utilize the hub site search capabilities to search across all associated case sites. Users can search for documents, lists, and items stored within any of the case sites.

	•	Set up custom search scopes in the hub site to refine searches based on metadata, which helps in quickly locating documents and information across cases.

11. Manage Data with Metadata and Retention Policies

	•	Metadata: Ensure that each case site has standardized metadata fields (e.g., “Case Number,” “Client Name,” “Status”). This helps in organizing and searching for content across multiple sites.

	•	Retention Policies: Define retention policies in SharePoint to automatically archive or delete content in individual case sites based on age, status, or other criteria. This prevents data overload in active sites.

13. Monitor and Manage Sites

	•	Site Directory: Maintain a centralized list of all case sites in the hub site to track their status and details. Include columns for metadata like “Case Name,” “URL,” “Status,” “Assigned To,” etc.

	•	Automated Updates: Use Power Automate to keep this list updated. For instance, when a case site is created, the flow can add its details to the list.

	•	Site Decommissioning: Use Power Automate to flag and decommission sites that are marked as “Closed” or “Archived,” moving relevant documents to an archive repository.

15. Use SharePoint Site Limits and Best Practices

	•	Site Collection Limits: SharePoint Online allows up to 2,000,000 site collections per tenant. Since each case site is a separate site collection, you should remain within operational limits.

	•	Optimize Site Design: Keep individual case sites lightweight by limiting the number of document libraries, lists, and large files.

17. Aggregate Case Data in Power Apps or Power BI

	•	PowerApps: Continue using PowerApps to interface with the centralized list on the hub site. Use the list to display high-level information and provide links to individual case sites.

	•	Power BI: If you need more detailed analytics, use Power BI to connect to SharePoint and aggregate data from all case sites for reporting and insights.

Example Workflow Using Power Automate

Here’s a simplified workflow to create and manage case sites:

	1.	Trigger: When a new item is added to the “Cases” list in the hub site (e.g., when a new case is opened).
 
	2.	Create Site: Use the Send an HTTP request to SharePoint action to create a new site collection using the site template.
 
	3.	Initialize Site: Apply the site design (which includes libraries, lists, and default pages) to the newly created case site.
 
	4.	Update Centralized List: Add the new site’s metadata (URL, case name, status) to the central “Cases” list in the hub site.
 
	5.	Automate Document Management: Set up additional flows to manage documents, notifications, and updates across the hub and case sites.
