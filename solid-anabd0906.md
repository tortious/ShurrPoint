<h2>Structure Of Sharepoint</h2>
<p>We know that, sharepoint is a content management platform.</p>
<p>This below pictures shows that, how content in sharepoint envorironment is organized hierarchically.</p>
<img src="https://www.aquaforest.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Sharepoint-Structure.png">
<p>Basically, Sharepoint has five layers</p>
<h3>Sharepoint Instance</h3>
<p>A <strong>SharePoint Instance</strong> is the entire environment where all the information, websites, and resources for an organization are managed and stored. It's like the main system or "container" that includes all the sites and content your organization uses in SharePoint or Office 365.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Company Example:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If "Tech Corp" is a company using SharePoint, the <strong>SharePoint Instance</strong> is everything that Tech Corp owns and manages in SharePoint, like all the data, documents, and sites used by every department, such as HR, Sales, and Engineering.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>School Example:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>For a university using SharePoint, the <strong>SharePoint Instance</strong> is where the entire school's data is managed. It would include separate sections (or site collections) for different departments like "Admissions," "Faculty Resources," and "Student Projects."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In simple terms, the <strong>SharePoint Instance</strong> is the complete setup where all the websites, files, and resources for an organization live and can be accessed.</p>

<h3>Site Collections</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>Site Collection</strong> is a group of related websites within SharePoint. Each site collection can contain multiple sites that share common settings, like permissions and themes, but each site within a collection has its own unique purpose and content.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Company Example:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a company like "Tech Corp," there might be separate site collections for different departments, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>One for "Human Resources" with different sites for "Employee Policies," "Recruitment," and "Training Programs."</li>
          <li>Another for "Sales" with sites for "Sales Reports," "Customer Contacts," and "Marketing Materials."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>School Example:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a university, there could be site collections for various faculties or departments:
        <ul>
          <li>One for the "Engineering Faculty" with sites like "Student Projects," "Course Materials," and "Faculty Resources."</li>
          <li>Another for the "Admissions Department" with sites for "Application Forms," "Accepted Students," and "Admissions Events."</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In short, a <strong>Site Collection</strong> is a way to organize SharePoint sites by grouping related ones together, making it easier to manage and share information across different parts of an organization.</p>

<h3>Sites</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>Site</strong> in SharePoint is a specific website within a <strong>Site Collection</strong>. Each site serves a particular purpose and contains content that is related to that purpose. Sites allow teams or departments to organize and collaborate on specific tasks or projects.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Company Example:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a company like "Tech Corp," within the "Human Resources" site collection, you might have different sites for different purposes:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Employee Policies</strong> site: Stores company policies and employee guidelines.</li>
          <li><strong>Recruitment</strong> site: Manages hiring processes, candidate resumes, and job descriptions.</li>
          <li><strong>Training Programs</strong> site: Provides resources and schedules for employee training sessions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>School Example:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a university, within the "Engineering Faculty" site collection, there might be different sites such as:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Student Projects</strong> site: For storing and sharing student project reports.</li>
          <li><strong>Course Materials</strong> site: For posting lectures, assignments, and reading materials for students.</li>
          <li><strong>Faculty Resources</strong> site: For faculty members to share resources, schedules, and announcements.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In simple terms, a <strong>Site</strong> is a specific space within SharePoint that allows teams or departments to focus on their work, collaborate, and store relevant content in an organized way.</p>


<h3>Library</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p>A <strong>Library</strong> in SharePoint is a place within a site where documents, files, and other content are stored. It is similar to a folder or file storage system on your computer, but it provides additional features like version control, metadata, and sharing options to better organize and manage documents.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Company Example:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a company like "Tech Corp," within the "Recruitment" site, you might have libraries such as:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Job Descriptions</strong> library: Stores all job role descriptions in the company.</li>
          <li><strong>Candidate Resumes</strong> library: Stores resumes of all job candidates.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>School Example:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a university, within the "Student Projects" site, there might be libraries such as:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Project Reports</strong> library: Stores reports and documents for student projects.</li>
          <li><strong>Presentations</strong> library: Stores slides and materials for student presentations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In simple terms, a <strong>Library</strong> is a storage space within a site where related documents and files are kept, making it easier to organize, track, and share content.</p>

<h3>List vs Library</h3>
<p>In SharePoint, both <strong>Lists</strong> and <strong>Libraries</strong> are used to store information, but they are designed for different types of content. A <strong>List</strong> is used to store structured data like tasks, contacts, or calendar events, while a <strong>Library</strong> is specifically designed to store documents and files.</p>

<p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>List:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>List</strong> stores structured data in rows and columns (similar to a table in a database or spreadsheet).</li>
      <li>Used to track things like tasks, contacts, or events.</li>
      <li>Items in a list can contain text, numbers, dates, and more.</li>
      <li>Example: A <strong>Task List</strong> to track work assignments, or a <strong>Contact List</strong> with names, phone numbers, and email addresses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Library:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>Library</strong> stores files (documents, spreadsheets, presentations, etc.) and provides tools for document management like versioning, check-out, and sharing.</li>
      <li>Used primarily for storing and managing documents.</li>
      <li>Items in a library are typically files that can be opened, edited, and shared.</li>
      <li>Example: A <strong>Document Library</strong> to store files like Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, or PowerPoint presentations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example to Illustrate:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Company Example:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a company like "Tech Corp," a <strong>Task List</strong> could be used in the "Projects" site to manage tasks for different teams, whereas a <strong>Document Library</strong> could be used in the same site to store all project-related documents.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>School Example:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In a university, a <strong>Contact List</strong> might be used to store student details, while a <strong>Document Library</strong> could store lecture slides, project reports, and other educational materials.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, a <strong>List</strong> is for managing data in a structured format, while a <strong>Library</strong> is for storing and managing files and documents.</p>

<h3>SharePoint Column Data Types with Examples</h3>

<p>In SharePoint, columns define the type of data you can store in a list. These columns can be configured in various ways depending on the type of data you need to store (e.g., text, numbers, dates). Below is a detailed explanation of each column data type, along with multiple examples to show how they can be used effectively.</p>

<p><strong>1. Single Line of Text</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Description:</strong> This column type is used for storing short strings of text, such as names, titles, or short descriptions. It allows for just a single line of text per item.</li>
  <li><strong>Example Use Cases:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Employee Name: Stores the names of employees.</li>
      <li>Project Title: Stores the title of a project.</li>
      <li>Product Code: Stores unique product identifiers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Example Values:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Employee Name <br><strong>Value:</strong> John Doe</li>
      <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Project Title <br><strong>Value:</strong> "Website Redesign"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Multiple Lines of Text</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Description:</strong> Used for longer text, this column allows multiple lines of input, which is ideal for comments, descriptions, or notes. You can choose whether the text is plain or formatted.</li>
  <li><strong>Example Use Cases:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Job Description: Stores detailed job roles and responsibilities.</li>
      <li>Comments: Used to collect feedback or comments on a specific task or item.</li>
      <li>Project Description: A description of a project that may span multiple lines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Example Values:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Job Description <br><strong>Value:</strong> "Responsible for managing the team, handling client communication, and ensuring timely project delivery."</li>
      <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Comments <br><strong>Value:</strong> "The task is progressing well, but we need more information from the client to complete it."</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Choice</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Description:</strong> This column allows you to create a drop-down menu of predefined options. You can allow users to select only one option or multiple options from the list.</li>
