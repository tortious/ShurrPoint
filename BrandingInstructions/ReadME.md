### Accessing the Create Theme Interface in SharePoint Online
Since your screenshots show you're already in the "Create theme" page within a SharePoint site (likely accessed via Site branding or Change the look), I'll start from there. If you're not, here's how to get to it:

1. Log in to your SharePoint Online site (e.g., the "Mordini Law, PC" site shown in your screenshots).
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the top-right corner.
3. Select "Site branding" from the menu (if available; this is typically under Settings > Change the look > Theme for site-level themes, but your screenshots suggest a direct "Site branding" option or Brand Center integration).
4. In the Site branding panel, switch to the "Themes" tab.
5. Click "+ New theme" to open the "Create theme" interface, which matches your screenshots: a left panel for adding colors, selecting primary theme color, adding secondary colors, and creating combinations, with a right panel for "Review your theme" showing color combinations and an "Example" preview of how the theme applies to site elements like headers, cards, and buttons.

Note: If you're a Global Admin or SharePoint Admin, you can create tenant-level themes in the Brand Center for organization-wide use. To access it:
- Go to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (admin.microsoft.com).
- Navigate to Settings > Org settings > Brand Center.
- Set up or access the Brand Center site, then under "Apply your brand" > "SharePoint," click "Add theme" to enter a similar interface.
- For dark-only themes, focus on selecting dark hex codes for backgrounds (e.g., #1E1E1E for blackish-dark or #3A3A3A for dark grey) and lighter accents for readability. SharePoint doesn't have a built-in "dark mode toggle" in themes, but by defining dark backgrounds with high-contrast accents, the theme will render as dark. Use the built-in accessibility checker (visible in the preview) to ensure contrast ratios meet standards (e.g., 4.5:1 for text).

### General Tips for Creating Dark-Only Themes
- **Dark-Only Focus**: To ensure themes are "dark only," always select dark colors (low lightness, e.g., hex codes starting with low values like #000000 to #4D4D4D) for primary/background slots. Pair them with lighter secondary/accent colors for buttons, links, and text to maintain usability. Avoid light backgrounds in combinations.
- **Adding Colors**: Click "+ Add color" at the top to input hex codes or use the color picker. Name them for easy reference (e.g., "Dark Grey Background").
- **Primary Theme Color**: This is the main background or dominant color—set it to a dark shade for dark themes.
- **Secondary Colors**: Add multiple accents here (e.g., for highlights, buttons). Click the arrow next to each to expand and edit.
- **New Combinations**: Below primary or secondary sections, click "+ New combination" to pair a background (dark) with accents (light). This creates variants shown in the "Color combinations" preview on the right.
- **Review and Preview**: The right side shows "All" or "By color" views of combinations (small squares like black with pink, orange, etc., as in your first screenshot) and an "Example" mockup of a site (header in primary, cards in secondary, as in your screenshots).
- **Saving**: Click "Next" to name the theme and save. It will appear in your site's theme picker under "Change the look > Theme."
- **Visual Example Reference**: Your screenshots show examples like:
  - First: Primary #3A3A3A (dark grey), secondary Pastel Pink #FFB0EA, #FA9878 (orange), #4ECDED (light blue); combinations like black-pink-orange; example with dark header, orange/pink/blue cards.
  - Second: Primary #1E1E1E (black), secondary #9D4EDD (purple); simple purple accents on dark.
  - Third: Primary #7ED957 (green, but light—avoid for dark-only), secondary #1E1E1E (black), #FF4F64 (red); example with green/red on dark.

Repeat the process for each theme below.

### Creating the Light Blue, Orange, White, and Dark Grey Dark-Only Theme
This theme uses dark grey as the primary (background) for darkness, with light blue and orange as accents, white for text/highlights. Hex codes: Dark Grey (#3A3A3A), Light Blue (#4ECDED), Orange (#FA9878), White (#FFFFFF).

1. In the "Create theme" page, click "+ Add color" at the top.
2. Input #3A3A3A (or pick a dark grey shade), name it "Dark Grey Background," and save.
3. Add #4ECDED, name "Light Blue Accent."
4. Add #FA9878, name "Orange Accent."
5. Add #FFFFFF, name "White Text."
6. Under "Primary theme color," click the dropdown and select your "Dark Grey Background" (#3A3A3A). This sets the overall dark base, similar to your first screenshot's primary.
7. Below primary, click "+ New combination" to pair it with accents: Select Dark Grey as background, then add small squares for Light Blue, Orange, and White (drag or select). This creates combos like dark grey with light blue/orange/white, visible in the "Color combinations" preview (small icons on right, like black-pink-orange in your first screenshot).
8. Under "Secondary colors," click the expander (>) and add your accents: Light Blue, Orange, White. For each, you can add sub-combinations if needed (e.g., white text on orange background, but keep backgrounds dark—avoid light ones).
9. Review the right panel: "Color combinations" should show dark-dominant pairs (e.g., dark grey square with light blue/orange dots, like your first screenshot's pink/orange/blue). The "Example" below should preview a dark header (#3A3A3A), with cards in orange/light blue accents on dark, white text—similar to your first screenshot's orange and blue blocks.
10. If the preview looks too light, adjust combinations to ensure no light backgrounds are used (negate with dark primaries).
11. Click "Next" at the bottom.
12. Name the theme (e.g., "Dark Light Blue Orange") and save.
13. Apply: Go back to Settings > Change the look > Theme, select your new theme, and save. The site will now have a dark grey base with light blue/orange/white highlights.

Visual Example: This will look like your first screenshot but darker—primary bar as #3A3A3A (dark grey strip), secondary bars in #4ECDED (blue), #FA9878 (orange), with combinations showing dark squares accented by blue/orange/white, and example site with dark nav, orange content blocks, blue buttons, white text.

### Creating the Watermelon Dark-Only Theme
Watermelon evokes red flesh (#FF4F64), green rind (#7ED957 but darken for dark-only, e.g., #4CAF50 dark green), black seeds (#1E1E1E), white (#FFFFFF). For dark-only, use dark green or black as primary background, red/green as accents.

Hex codes: Dark Green (#4CAF50), Red (#FF4F64), Black (#1E1E1E), White (#FFFFFF). (Adjust if needed for true watermelon vibe—e.g., #228B22 for deeper green.)

1. In "Create theme," click "+ Add color."
2. Input #1E1E1E (black for ultra-dark base), name "Black Background."
3. Add #4CAF50, name "Dark Green Rind."
4. Add #FF4F64, name "Red Flesh Accent."
5. Add #FFFFFF, name "White Seeds/Text."
6. Set "Primary theme color" to "Black Background" (#1E1E1E) or "Dark Green Rind" (#4CAF50) for a greenish dark tint, like the green primary in your third screenshot but darkened.
7. Click "+ New combination" below primary: Pair the dark primary as background with Red, Dark Green, White accents. This builds combos like black with red/green/white dots, shown in right preview (similar to your third screenshot's green-black-red combos).
8. Under "Secondary colors," add Red, Dark Green, White. Expand each to fine-tune (e.g., red on black background for accents).
9. Check the "Review your theme" section: "Color combinations" will display dark squares with red/green/white accents (e.g., like your third screenshot's green-red-black). The "Example" will show a dark header (#1E1E1E or #4CAF50), red cards, green highlights, white text—ensuring a watermelon-inspired but fully dark palette (no light backgrounds).
10. If accessibility flags low contrast (e.g., dark green on black), lighten accents slightly or use white more for text.
11. Click "Next," name it (e.g., "Dark Watermelon"), and save.
12. Apply as above.

Visual Example: Resembling your third screenshot—primary as dark green/black strip, secondary red (#FF4F64 like the red bar), with combinations of dark backgrounds accented by red/green/white, and example site featuring dark nav, red content areas, green buttons, white lines—creating a moody, watermelon-themed dark interface.

If you need more themes or adjustments (e.g., exact hex tweaks via code execution for contrast checks), provide details. Test previews thoroughly for dark fidelity!
