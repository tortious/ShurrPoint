## Miscellaneous Tips for SharePoint Tenant

---

### Best Practice Tips

1. Turn Document Versioning on
2. Naming configs stick - even changing later, the url remains the same.
3. do not add spaces when naming libraries or sites.
4. use metadata rather than folders - keep it flat.
5. **Keep it to 1 type of content per library**
