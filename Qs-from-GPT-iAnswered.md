# SharePoint Intranet Recommendations and Considerations

This is a thorough and detailed responseâ€”great job providing everything in one place! Here's a breakdown of recommendations and considerations based on your input to help build your SharePoint intranet efficiently:

## General Structure

### Hierarchy and Navigation
- Use **hub sites** for Case Management, Administration, Technology, Knowledge Base, and Client Portals. Each hub will connect associated team sites and maintain uniform branding.
- Set up a **global navigation bar** linking all hubs with a persistent "Home" link.
- Include **quick links** for frequent documents in each hub, but avoid overloading to address your concern about frequent document visibility.

### Permissions
- Create **permission groups**:
  - "Global Admin" for you.
  - "Team Admin" for Mark, Jane, and yourself (for specific hubs/sites).
  - "External Users" for adjusters, restricted to their team sites.
- Ensure **Tech Hub** access is exclusive to you, with specific libraries for personal projects.

## Content Management

### Document Management
- Replace folders with **document sets** across all sites for standardization.
- Use metadata fields: **Case ID, Claim Number, Client, Adjuster, and Jurisdiction** for search and filters.

### Retention Policies
- Apply a **retention policy** to delete/archive legal documents after 3 years unless marked as "Do Not Delete" (e.g., litigation hold).

---

## Case Management

### New Case Automation
- Use **Power Automate** to create team sites for new cases:
  - Include libraries: **Assignment Files, Court Documents, Correspondence, and Evidence**.
  - Automate metadata tagging during site creation (e.g., populate fields for adjuster, case ID, etc.).

### Client Data
- Set up a **centralized contact list** with a lookup column for Opposing Counsel and Clients.
- Enable filters for adjuster-specific views.

### Tracking Case Progress
- Use a **SharePoint list** for simplicity:
  - Fields: **Case ID, Adjuster, Milestones, Deadline, Status**.
  - Automate updates via Power Automate to notify staff of milestones.

---

## Collaboration

### Teamwork Tools
- Enable **Microsoft Teams integration** for discussions and shared workspaces.
- Use a **shared calendar** for Mark and mirror it with yours for collaboration.

### External Sharing
- Use **SharePoint permissions** and sharing links to restrict adjusters to their cases.
- For sensitive data:
  - Require **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for external users.
  - Enable **"View Only" permissions** for external document access.

---

## Automation & Customization

### Automation with Power Automate
- **Email Flows**:
  - "New Assignment" emails: Parse attachments and save to a temporary library in the Case Management hub.
  - "Invoice" emails: Forward them to a designated folder (e.g., "Invoice Email Folder").
- **Task Automation**: Notify staff of deadlines, assign tasks, and move documents to team sites when created.

### Customization
- Apply **firm branding** (logo, colors) across all sites.
- Use a **homepage** for dynamic content:
  - Recent announcements, quick links, and case updates.

---

## Training and Adoption

### Ease of Use
- Focus on a **user-friendly**, minimalist design with clear instructions on navigation and usage.
- Create **training materials** or quick-start guides after the main setup.

### Knowledge Base
- Include visual representations of content types and instructions for using the system.
- House these resources in a dedicated **team site** under the Knowledge Base hub.

---

## IT and Security

### Compliance
- Ensure **HIPAA compliance** by enabling data encryption at rest and in transit.
- Use **Azure Information Protection** to add security layers for sensitive documents.

### Integration
- Integrate tools like **QuickBooks Online** and **Visual Studio Code** where possible (e.g., QuickBooks data summaries in SharePoint dashboards).
- Look into **Microsoft Power BI** for reporting on invoices and case progress.

### Synchronization
- Enable real-time synchronization with Office 365 apps:
  - **Outlook** for shared calendars.
  - **OneDrive** for document backups.
  - **Teams** for discussions.

---

## Suggestions for Tools

### Project Management
- Look into **Microsoft Planner** or **Trello** for task tracking.

### Time Tracking
- Use **Clockify** or integrate with a QuickBooks-compatible tracker.

### Document Collaboration
- Explore **DocuSign** for e-signatures.
