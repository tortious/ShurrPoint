It sounds like the issue is related to the permissions and registration process of your PnP app in Azure Active Directory (now called Entra ID). This process involves ensuring that the app is properly registered, has the right API permissions, and is consented by the organization. Let’s go through the setup and common problems that could cause the error you’re experiencing.

Step-by-Step Guide to Register and Configure Your PnP App in Entra ID

1. Register the Application in Entra ID (Azure AD):

	•	Go to the Azure portal.
	•	Navigate to Azure Active Directory > App registrations > New registration.
	•	Provide the following:
	•	Name: Enter a meaningful name for the application (e.g., “PnP App”).
	•	Supported account types: Choose “Accounts in this organizational directory only” (Single tenant) for most internal apps.
	•	Redirect URI: For now, you can leave this blank if you are using PowerShell or select “Web” and enter https://localhost if you plan to run the app locally.
	•	Click Register.

2. Configure API Permissions:

	•	After registering the app, you’ll be redirected to the app’s overview page.
	•	Navigate to API permissions > Add a permission.
	•	Choose Microsoft Graph or SharePoint as the API.
	•	Select the necessary permissions based on your app’s functionality:
	•	For Graph API: Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All, User.Read.
	•	For SharePoint API: Sites.Manage.All, Sites.FullControl.All.
	•	Click Add permissions.
	•	If you see any permissions requiring admin consent, click Grant admin consent for [your organization].

3. Set Up Client Secrets or Certificates:

	•	Navigate to Certificates & secrets.
	•	Under Client secrets, click New client secret.
	•	Provide a description and set an expiration period.
	•	Click Add and copy the Value (you will need this for the PnP app).

4. Update the App to Use the Registered App ID and Secret:

	•	In your PnP app or script, use the Application (client) ID and the client secret you generated.
	•	For example, if you are using the PnP PowerShell module, use:

Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com -ClientId "<Client ID>" -ClientSecret "<Client Secret>"



5. Set Redirect URI and API Permissions (Optional if Using PnP PowerShell):

	•	If your PnP app has a web component, go to Authentication and set the Redirect URIs correctly.
	•	Ensure the “Access tokens” and “ID tokens” checkboxes are selected under Implicit grant and hybrid flows in the Authentication section.

Common Issues and Troubleshooting

	1.	App Shows in Office.com but Gives an Error:
	•	This issue usually occurs due to missing API permissions or the lack of admin consent. Ensure the necessary permissions are granted, and the admin consent is provided.
	2.	Redirect URI Mismatch:
	•	If your app uses a redirect URI, ensure that the URI specified in Azure matches the one configured in your app. Even a small mismatch (like http vs. https) will cause an error.
	3.	Unauthorized Error:
	•	If you receive an unauthorized error while using the app, it often points to issues with the client ID, client secret, or API permissions.
	4.	Granting Admin Consent:
	•	After adding permissions, always grant admin consent. If you do not have admin privileges, request an admin to perform this action.

Verification Steps

	•	Verify in Entra ID: Go back to App registrations in Azure, find your app, and check if it has all the required permissions.
	•	Office 365 Permissions: In the Office 365 Admin Center, under Settings > Org settings > Services & add-ins, verify if your app has been granted the required permissions.
