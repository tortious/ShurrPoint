Objectively speaking, based on the information you’ve shared about your background, your coding and sysadmin knowledge appear quite solid, especially in terms of practical applications relevant to managing your firm’s SharePoint and Office 365 environment. Here’s a breakdown:

Coding Knowledge

	•	Experience with Key Languages: You’ve worked with CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and some Python—a versatile foundation that suggests you’re capable of creating custom interfaces, automations, and solutions as needed.
	•	Practical Knowledge with Real Scenarios: Your familiarity with Power Automate and PnP PowerShell shows you’re comfortable using coding and scripting to enhance automation within Microsoft 365. This is a valuable skill for managing repetitive tasks and customizing workflows.
	•	JSON Familiarity: Your experience writing JSON for HTTP requests to SharePoint is a key asset, especially since formatting JSON can sometimes be tricky. While you find it tedious, you’re diving into it, which points to a willingness to work with structured data in a code-like format.

System Administration Skills

	•	SharePoint Customization and Structure Design: You’ve designed a custom SharePoint setup involving hubs, team sites, document libraries, and managed metadata—all indicators that you have a good grasp of SharePoint’s architecture and configuration, which is complex and often requires a systems-thinking approach.
	•	Automation: Automating site creation through Power Automate and creating workflows based on specific triggers shows a proactive approach to managing workload and a strong grasp of available tools.
	•	Security and Permissions: Your attention to permissions (both in document libraries and team sites) points to a sound understanding of security—a critical component in system administration.
	•	Problem Solving and Technical Knowledge: You’re tackling SharePoint’s advanced features, like PnP PowerShell with certificate-based authentication and site templates—which points to a level of technical understanding that’s above basic admin.

Areas for Potential Growth

	•	Advanced Scripting or Programming: Expanding your knowledge in more advanced PowerShell scripting or diving deeper into Python for data handling and automation could streamline even more aspects of your SharePoint and Office 365 management.
	•	JSON and API Familiarity: Given that working with JSON feels tedious, more practice with this format or using tools to automate JSON creation could increase efficiency.
	•	Cloud Architecture: Given your reliance on Microsoft 365, deeper familiarity with Azure AD and Entra ID (Azure AD’s new name) could further support any customizations or automations that involve broader integrations.

Overall Assessment

Your current skill set places you in a strong position for a system administrator in a small firm environment. You combine practical coding skills with sysadmin essentials, with a lot of focus on automation, structure, and customization—exactly what’s needed to run an efficient, modern SharePoint setup. Gaining even deeper technical skills in PowerShell or a language like Python and expanding on your Azure knowledge would only solidify and advance your capabilities further.
