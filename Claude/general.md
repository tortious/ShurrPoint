I'll outline a practical SharePoint document management structure that aligns with civil defense/insurance case management. I'll break this down into two levels: high-level site organization and matter-specific document organization.

# Tenant Level Structure

```plaintext
Root
├── Active Matters
├── Closed Matters
├── Administrative
└── Knowledge Base
```

# Individual Matter Site Structure

```plaintext
Matter Site (e.g., "Smith v. Yellow Cab - 2024-0123")
├── 1_Pleadings
│   ├── Complaints
│   ├── Answers
│   ├── Motions
│   └── Orders
│
├── 2_Discovery
│   ├── Interrogatories
│   ├── Document_Requests
│   ├── Depositions
│   └── Evidence
│       ├── Accident_Reports
│       ├── Medical_Records
│       ├── Photos
│       └── Videos
│
├── 3_Correspondence
│   ├── Client_Communications
│   ├── Opposing_Counsel
│   └── Insurance_Carrier
│
├── 4_Research
│   ├── Case_Law
│   └── Memos
│
└── 5_Settlement
    ├── Demands
    ├── Negotiations
    └── Release_Documents
```

# Key Implementation Details:

1. Metadata (Document Library Columns):
```plaintext
- Document Type (Choice)
- Document Date
- Author/Responsible Attorney
- Document Status (Draft/Final)
- Insurance Claim Number
- Opposition Law Firm
- Filing Date (if applicable)
```

2. Views to Create:
```plaintext
- Recently Modified
- Upcoming Deadlines
- Critical Documents
- By Document Type
- By Attorney
```

3. Retention Settings:
- Active Matters: Full retention
- Closed Matters: 7 years (or per state requirements)
- Move to archive after case closure

4. Quick Links Navigation:
```plaintext
- Most Recent Documents
- Critical Case Documents
- Upcoming Deadlines
- Case Calendar
- Contact List (parties, witnesses, experts)
```

# Best Practices:

1. Naming Conventions:
```plaintext
[DATE YYYY-MM-DD]_[DOC TYPE]_[BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
Example: 2024-01-15_Motion_Summary_Judgment
```

2. Permission Levels:
```plaintext
- Partners: Full Control
- Associates: Edit
- Paralegals: Edit
- Support Staff: Contribute
- Insurance Adjusters: Read (specific folders only)
```

3. Version Control:
- Enable versioning on all document libraries
- Keep major versions: 5
- Keep minor versions: 2

4. Search Configuration:
- Create custom search scopes
- Configure managed properties for insurance-specific metadata
- Set up search refiners for common filters (doc type, date, attorney)

Would you like me to expand on any of these areas or provide specific SharePoint configuration steps for implementing this structure?
