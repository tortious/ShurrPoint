I'll help you create a robust solution for bulk provisioning SharePoint team sites. Let me break this down into clear, actionable steps.



Here's your step-by-step implementation guide:

1. **Prepare the CSV File**
   - Create a new CSV file named `sites.csv`
   - Include the following columns:
     - SiteTitle: Name of the site (e.g., "Smith v Jones")
     - SiteURL: URL-friendly name (e.g., "smith-jones")
     - SiteOwner: Email of the Big Permis Group
     - Template: Use "GROUP#0" for modern team sites
     - TimeZone: Use "11" for US Central Time
     - StorageQuota: In MB (e.g., "500")
     - ResourceQuota: Usually "0" for standard sites

2. **Prerequisites**
   - Install PowerShell 7 or higher
   - Ensure you have SharePoint Admin rights
   - Have the Big Permis Group created and populated in Azure AD
   - Run PowerShell as administrator
   - Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` to allow script execution

3. **Module Installation**
   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell -Force
   Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -Force
   ```

4. **Script Execution**
   - Save the script from the artifact above as `Create-BulkSites.ps1`
   - Update the following variables in the script:
     - Replace `yourtenant` with your SharePoint tenant name
     - Update the `$hubSiteUrl` to your Case Management Hub URL
     - Modify the Big Permis Group email if different

5. **Run the Script**
   ```powershell
   .\Create-BulkSites.ps1
   ```

6. **Verification Steps**
   - Check each created site in SharePoint Admin Center
   - Verify:
     - Site appears under the Case Management Hub
     - Custom scripts are enabled (Site Settings > Site collection features)
     - Content types are enabled (Site Settings > Site Collection Features)
     - Managed metadata is working (create a column using managed metadata)
     - Big Permis Group has Owner permissions

7. **Troubleshooting**
   - Check error_log.txt for any failed site creations
   - Common issues:
     - Site URL already exists
     - Insufficient permissions
     - Network connectivity issues
     - Quota limitations

8. **Best Practices**
   - Run a test with 1-2 sites first
   - Use meaningful, consistent naming conventions
   - Document any site-specific configurations
   - Keep the CSV backup for future reference
   - Monitor storage quotas

The script includes error handling, logging, and verification steps. It waits between operations to ensure SharePoint has time to process changes. The script also properly disconnects from services after completion.

Need any clarification on any of these steps?
