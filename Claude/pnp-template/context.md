Important notes about this script:

Before Running:

Replace [mytenant] with your actual tenant name
Ensure you have the necessary permissions on both sites
Install PnP PowerShell module if not already installed
Make sure the template path (C:\Templates) is accessible


Special Considerations:

The script includes the additional handlers shown in your XML file
It handles the custom content types and field definitions
It includes post-template tasks to ensure proper setup
It validates the presence of required lists and libraries


Running the Script:

    .\Apply-TerryTemplate.ps1

Validation:
After running, verify:


All document libraries are present
Content types are correctly configured
Navigation is set up properly
Security settings are applied
Custom fields are available
Document sets are configured


Troubleshooting:
If you encounter issues:


Check the logs in the console
Verify tenant admin permissions
Ensure all features are activated
Check for any custom solutions that need to be deployed separately

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail or focus on a specific aspect of the template application process?
