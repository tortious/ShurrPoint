Sure, here’s an expanded example that aligns more closely with your scenario, where we’ll use Court Number, Claim Number, Date Filed, and Adjuster as metadata fields in a document set.

Practical Example: Document Set for Case Management

Let’s say you handle cases for Acme Insurance, and each case has its own Court Number and Claim Number, is assigned an Adjuster, and has a specific Date Filed. Here’s how you can set up a document set to manage case-related documents, ensuring that all documents associated with a particular case have consistent metadata.

	1.	Create the Document Set Content Type:
	•	In SharePoint, create a new content type based on Document Set (this will be your template for all cases).
	•	Name it something like “Case Document Set” to indicate it’s used for case-specific organization.
	2.	Add Metadata Fields to the Document Set:
	•	Court Number: This field can be a managed metadata column connected to the term store if you want to standardize court numbers across cases and sites. For example, you might have a term set with court numbers organized by jurisdiction, making it easy to filter and search for specific court-related cases.
	•	Claim Number: Add a single-line text column for this, as each claim number is unique. This field will allow easy case identification within your library.
	•	Date Filed: Use a date field to capture the filing date, helping track timelines and easily filter documents by case age.
	•	Adjuster: Use a person or group field where you can assign the adjuster (like Colleen, Shirley, Chris, or Bob from Acme Insurance). This helps when filtering cases by adjuster or generating reports based on adjuster assignments.
	3.	Set Up Inheritance for Metadata:
	•	Configure the document set so that all documents within it automatically inherit the document set’s metadata values. For instance:
	•	When you upload a document to a “Case Document Set” with a court number of “2023-456”, a claim number of “AC12345”, and an adjuster named “Chris,” each document inherits this metadata.
	•	If you later add additional documents to the same set, they will also inherit these values without needing manual entry, maintaining consistency and saving time.
	4.	Organize Documents by Document Set in the Library:
	•	In your Case Management Library, create a new document set for each new case.
	•	Name each document set based on the Court Number or Claim Number to make it easy to identify.
	•	Each document set will then hold all relevant documents (e.g., police reports, witness statements, medical records) for that specific case, and every document inherits the metadata fields you set up.
	5.	Search and Filter Across Cases Using Metadata:
	•	You can now easily search or filter within the library by Court Number, Claim Number, Date Filed, or Adjuster.
	•	For instance, if you need to see all cases assigned to the adjuster “Shirley,” simply filter the Adjuster field in the library view.
	•	Similarly, if you need to pull up all documents associated with a specific court number or claim number, you can use those fields to find exactly what you need quickly.
	6.	Generating Reports and Views:
	•	You can create custom views within the library based on any of the metadata fields. For example:
	•	A view that shows all cases filed within the last 30 days by filtering on Date Filed.
	•	A view grouped by Adjuster to quickly see the case load for each adjuster.
	•	A view grouped by Court Number to track documents tied to each court.

Benefits of This Setup

	•	Consistency: All documents related to a specific case automatically inherit the correct court number, claim number, adjuster, and date filed.
	•	Time Savings: By inheriting metadata, you reduce the time spent manually tagging each document, minimizing data entry errors.
	•	Enhanced Search and Filter: With standardized metadata, you can efficiently search, filter, and organize your case documents across the library.
	•	Streamlined Reporting: With metadata on adjusters, court numbers, and claim numbers, you can easily create reports or pull views tailored to specific requirements.

Using document sets with custom metadata fields in this way lets you manage case documents effectively without overloading the term store while still taking advantage of structured metadata.
