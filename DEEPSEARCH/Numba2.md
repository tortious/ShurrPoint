# Guide: Integrating a Custom ChatGPT into SharePoint Online

Integrating ChatGPT with SharePoint Online can enhance your intranet or team sites with AI-powered assistance. This guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step approach, from choosing the integration method to deploying a secure solution. We’ll cover using your Microsoft 365 Business Standard environment (with minimal extra cost) and leverage SharePoint Framework (SPFx), Power Automate, and PnP/PnPjs for a seamless integration.

## 1. Choosing the Best ChatGPT Integration Approach

**Evaluate Azure OpenAI vs OpenAI API:** You have two primary ways to use ChatGPT’s capabilities: Microsoft’s **Azure OpenAI Service** or the **OpenAI API** (from OpenAI directly). Given a Microsoft 365 Business Standard license (and no Enterprise extras), the **OpenAI API** is often the most straightforward and cost-effective choice ([OpenAI vs. Azure OpenAI Services - Private AI](https://www.private-ai.com/en/2024/01/09/openai-vs-azure-openai/#:~:text=OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20API%20services%20come%20with,over%20the%20first%20three%20months)). The OpenAI API lets you use models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 with a pay-as-you-go model (you’ll need to create an OpenAI account and obtain an API key). Azure OpenAI provides the same models hosted in Azure, but it requires an Azure subscription and initial approval to use the service. 

- *Cost and Setup:* OpenAI’s API generally charges only for usage (tokens processed), and is known to be **cheaper and easier to start** with than Azure’s offering ([OpenAI vs. Azure OpenAI Services - Private AI](https://www.private-ai.com/en/2024/01/09/openai-vs-azure-openai/#:~:text=OpenAI%E2%80%99s%20API%20services%20come%20with,over%20the%20first%20three%20months)). Azure OpenAI, in contrast, bills through Azure (with possible capacity units or hourly charges for reserved capacity) and might have higher enterprise-grade costs. For a small-scale or budget-conscious project, OpenAI API’s pay-per-use model avoids upfront fees.  
- *Infrastructure and Licensing:* With Azure OpenAI, you’d integrate via Azure AD and can use Azure’s security features. However, Business Standard does **not** include Azure OpenAI— you’d need to set up an Azure resource (which could incur costs). OpenAI’s API only requires the API key from your OpenAI account, with no additional Microsoft licensing. This makes it highly feasible **without additional Microsoft 365 costs** (you’ll just pay OpenAI for usage).  
- *Security and Data:* Azure OpenAI is preferred by enterprises needing data residency, Azure’s network integration, and AD-based security. It ensures your data is not used to improve the model and offers isolation ([The 5 Main Differences Between OpenAI and Microsoft Azure OpenAI - US Cloud](https://www.uscloud.com/blog/the-differences-between-openai-and-microsoft-azure-openai/#:~:text=Category%20OpenAI%20Azure%20OpenAI%20Data,responsible%20AI%20and%20misuse%20prevention)) ([The 5 Main Differences Between OpenAI and Microsoft Azure OpenAI - US Cloud](https://www.uscloud.com/blog/the-differences-between-openai-and-microsoft-azure-openai/#:~:text=OpenAI%20offers%20flexible%20pricing%20for,times%20and%20guaranteed%20service%20continuity)). OpenAI API also allows opting out of data logging for model training, but data goes through OpenAI’s servers. For most scenarios, if you avoid sending sensitive data in prompts, the OpenAI API is sufficient and easier to implement. Azure OpenAI would be viable if your organization already uses Azure services and requires stricter data control or integration with Azure AD.  

**Recommendation:** For a Business Standard user aiming to avoid extra subscriptions, start with the **OpenAI API**. It’s quick to obtain an API key and start calling ChatGPT. Azure OpenAI is powerful, but setting up the environment and obtaining access introduces overhead that may not be justified for a small deployment ([Microsoft Azure OpenAI vs OpenAI - How do you choose?](https://www.proarch.com/blog/microsoft-azure-openai-vs-openai-how-do-you-choose#:~:text=2,more%20manual%20setup%20and%20considerations)). You can always switch to Azure OpenAI later if needed (for example, if you want to leverage managed identity or enterprise security at scale). 

## 2. Configuring Entra ID (Azure AD) and Authentication

To allow ChatGPT to interact with SharePoint (and possibly other Microsoft 365 data), you’ll set up an **Azure AD application (service principal)** with appropriate permissions. This will enable secure, authenticated calls from your integration (SPFx web part or Power Automate) to SharePoint or Graph APIs.

**2.1 Register an Azure AD Application:** 

1. **Create the app registration:** In the Azure AD admin center (Entra ID), go to **App Registrations** and choose *New Registration*. Give it a name like “ChatGPTIntegrationApp”. For this scenario, you can use **Accounts in this organizational directory only** (single tenant) since it’s for your tenant. You don’t need to specify a redirect URI for a purely back-end app scenario. Click **Register** to create the app.  
2. **Create a client secret:** In the app’s overview, go to **Certificates & Secrets** > *Client Secrets*. Add a new client secret (give it a name like “ChatGPTSecret” and an expiration period). **Copy the secret value** and save it securely – you’ll need this for authentication from Power Automate or custom code.  
3. **Note the IDs:** Make note of the **Application (Client) ID** and the **Directory (Tenant) ID** from the app’s overview page – these, along with the secret, will be used to obtain tokens.

**2.2 Grant API Permissions for SharePoint Online:** 

Now, configure what this app can do. In Azure AD, under your app registration, find **API Permissions** and add permissions that allow SharePoint operations. You have two routes here:

- **Using Microsoft Graph permissions:** This is the modern approach. For example, to allow reading/writing SharePoint site data, add the Graph permission **Sites.ReadWrite.All**. For user data or profile info, you might add **User.Read.All**, etc. If you need to create or manage lists and items, Sites.ReadWrite.All (and perhaps **Files.ReadWrite.All** for files) would cover it. Choose **Application permissions** (which allow the app to act as a background service) if you plan to run automation without a signed-in user. After adding, **grant admin consent** for the tenant so the permission is active ([SharePoint App Azure Authentication | DynamicPoint](https://www.dynamicpoint.com/knowledge-base/general/security/sharepoint-azure-authentication/#:~:text=8,app%20registration%20provides%20are%20configured)). (As a global admin or SharePoint admin, you must consent to application permissions.) 

- **Using SharePoint-specific permissions:** In the API Permissions blade, you can also select the **SharePoint** API. For example, under SharePoint **Application Permissions** you might find **Sites.Manage.All** (full control of site collections) ([SharePoint App Azure Authentication | DynamicPoint](https://www.dynamicpoint.com/knowledge-base/general/security/sharepoint-azure-authentication/#:~:text=Image%20%203,time%20select%20Delegated%20permissions%20Image)), and under **Delegated Permissions** you could use **AllSites.Write** (if you want to allow a signed-in user context to write to any site) ([SharePoint App Azure Authentication | DynamicPoint](https://www.dynamicpoint.com/knowledge-base/general/security/sharepoint-azure-authentication/#:~:text=Image%20%204,User.Read.All)). In many cases, Graph permissions cover the same operations, so Microsoft recommends Graph, but SharePoint API permissions can be used for certain granular scenarios. If you use these, also grant admin consent. 

 ([SharePoint App Azure Authentication | DynamicPoint](https://www.dynamicpoint.com/knowledge-base/general/security/sharepoint-azure-authentication/)) *Configured API permissions for the Azure AD app.* (In this example, the app has delegated and application permissions for SharePoint and Graph. Notice **Sites.Manage.All** and **AllSites.Write** for broad SharePoint access.) 

For our integration, **Application permissions** are useful because our ChatGPT integration will run as an automated service. For instance, granting **Sites.ReadWrite.All** (Graph) or **Sites.Manage.All** (SharePoint) allows the service to read/write to all site collections without a user. Use caution: only grant what’s necessary (principle of least privilege). If you want to limit scope, consider Graph’s **Sites.Selected** permission, which allows an admin to approve specific site access for the app. (This requires using PowerShell to grant the app access to particular site IDs.)

**2.3 Setting up Authentication in Power Automate and PnP/PnPjs:** 

With the app registered and permissions granted, you have an identity to use in automation:

- **Using the app in Power Automate (client credentials flow):** Power Automate doesn’t directly let you choose a service principal in standard SharePoint actions. However, you can use an **HTTP request** to acquire a token and call SharePoint or Graph. In a flow, you would perform an HTTP POST to Azure AD’s token endpoint (`https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/token`) with your client ID, client secret, tenant ID, and resource scope (e.g. Graph “https://graph.microsoft.com/.default”). This will return an access token. You can then use another HTTP action to call the Graph or SharePoint REST API, adding the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Essentially, you’re performing the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow within your Power Automate. This requires the **HTTP action (a premium connector)** ([GitHub - Zerg00s/open-ai-teams-chat-bot: This Github repository contains two Power Automate flows that use OpenAI to answer questions in Teams. One flow uses the Standalone OpenAI service, while the other uses Azure OpenAI.](https://github.com/Zerg00s/open-ai-teams-chat-bot#:~:text=the%20text,to%20generate%20responses)). Alternatively, you could register a **Custom Connector** in Power Platform for the Graph API using OAuth 2.0 with your app’s credentials – this would abstract the token fetching. Keep in mind that the HTTP action is considered premium, meaning if you only have the standard license included with M365, you might need a per-user Power Automate plan to use it.

- **Using the app in PnP or PnPjs:** If you write custom code (say in an Azure Function or console app using PnP Core SDK or PnP PowerShell), you can authenticate using the app’s client ID and certificate/secret. For example, PnP PowerShell’s `Connect-PnPOnline -ClientId <ID> -Tenant <tenant>.onmicrosoft.com -ClientSecret <secret> -Url <site>` allows app-only login to SharePoint. In PnPjs (JavaScript library in SPFx), app-only isn’t directly usable in the browser (since client secret shouldn’t be exposed there). Instead, in SPFx we rely on the user context (which is handled by SPFx automatically via ADAL/MSAL when using Graph or the SP HttpClient). In our scenario, we might not use app credentials in the SPFx web part (because that runs in the browser), but rather use them in server-side components like Power Automate flows or an Azure Function called by the web part.

**2.4 Delegated vs Application Permissions for SPFx:** SPFx web parts typically run under the current user’s context. If you want the web part itself to call Graph API on behalf of the user (for example, to read user’s data with their consent), you’d configure **Delegated** Graph permissions and in the SPFx solution package specify those in `package-solution.json`. An admin would then **approve the delegated permissions** for the SPFx app (via the SharePoint admin API management page). This way, your SPFx code can use the `MSGraphClient` or `AadHttpClient` to call Graph with the user’s token (no need to handle secrets). For instance, to allow listing the user’s files, you might request Files.Read for delegated use. 

For administrative operations or background tasks (like creating a site or running as admin regardless of user permissions), you use application permissions via the techniques above (Power Automate flow or external service) because SPFx cannot on its own use an application permission token (since that requires a secret and runs server-side).

**2.5 Summary:** At this point, you have an Azure AD **App ID**, **Client Secret**, and appropriate **permissions** to access SharePoint data. This identity will be used in your solution’s back-end calls (Power Automate or any middleware) to perform SharePoint tasks requested by ChatGPT. Now let’s move to building the user-facing component: an SPFx web part that connects everything.

## 3. SPFx Web Part Development Using VS Code

To create a custom ChatGPT interface in SharePoint, an SPFx web part is ideal. You will build a web part that allows users to ask questions (or issue commands), calls the ChatGPT API for a response, and displays it – possibly also triggering SharePoint actions via PnPjs or flows.

**3.1 Set up the Development Environment:** Ensure you have a working SPFx development setup on your machine:

- **Node.js:** Install the latest LTS version of Node.js (v18 as of this guide) ([Set up your SharePoint Framework development environment | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment#:~:text=Install%20Node)). SPFx v1.20 (and above) supports Node 18. You can verify your Node version by running `node -v` in a terminal. 
- **Yeoman and Gulp:** SPFx uses Yeoman generators and Gulp. Install Yeoman and the SPFx generator globally by running: 

  ```bash
  npm install -g yo @microsoft/generator-sharepoint gulp-cli
  ``` 

  This installs Yeoman, the SharePoint Framework generator, and Gulp command-line tools ([Set up your SharePoint Framework development environment | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment#:~:text=npm%20install%20gulp,global)). 

- **Visual Studio Code:** While you can use any editor, VS Code is highly recommended for SPFx projects. Install it if not already installed.

**3.2 Scaffold a New SPFx Web Part Project:** 

1. Create a directory for your project (e.g., `ChatGPTWebPart`) and open a console in that directory. Run the SPFx Yeoman generator:

   ```bash
   yo @microsoft/sharepoint
   ```

   You’ll be prompted for information:
   - **Solution Name:** (e.g., “ChatGPTWebPart”; you can accept the default).
   - **Target**: Choose “SharePoint Online only (latest)” to target SharePoint Online.
   - **Permissions**: You can say “N” (no) when asked about tenant-wide deployment or unique API access for now (we’ll handle API calls manually).
   - **Component Type:** Choose “WebPart”.
   - **Web part Name:** (e.g., “ChatGPT Assistant”).
   - **Framework:** You can choose React to build the UI easily (this guide assumes React for interface, though you could use No JavaScript framework or others as well).

   The generator will create the project structure and install npm packages. Once done, open the project in VS Code (`code .` if you’re in the folder).

2. **Run the local Workbench (for testing):** In the project folder, run `gulp serve` to start the local SPFx workbench. If you append `?debug=true&noredir=true` to a SharePoint page URL, you can load your debug web part in SharePoint as well ([GitHub - Paul-Borisov/react-azure-open-ai-chat-web-part-spfx: Azure OpenAI SPFx web part for SharePoint Online offering user experience familiar to ChatGPT users. Supports Azure & Native OpenAI endpoints published via Azure API Management, Private & Shared Chats, Storage Encryption, Event Streaming, Code Highlighting, Full-screen mode, optional internet & data Integrations, PDF & Image analysis, Dalle3 Images](https://github.com/Paul-Borisov/react-azure-open-ai-chat-web-part-spfx#:~:text=,using%20a%20format%20like)). Initially, you’ll see a placeholder web part. We will modify it to add ChatGPT functionality.

**3.3 Implementing ChatGPT API Call in the Web Part:**

Edit the web part code (for React, open the `.tsx` file in `src/webparts/.../components/`). We will add logic to call the OpenAI API:

- **Importing fetch or HTTP library:** SPFx projects can use the browser `fetch` API to call external services. We’ll use `fetch` for simplicity. Ensure the API domain is allowable – by default, SPFx doesn’t block external calls, but the external service must permit CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Notably, the OpenAI API **does not enable CORS** by default, meaning a direct call from the browser might be blocked. We have two strategies:
  - **Direct call (for testing):** Try calling OpenAI API directly via fetch. For this to work in a browser, the API must allow it. OpenAI’s policy might block it, so this is primarily for testing in uncontrolled environments.
  - **Via a proxy (recommended):** Use a secured intermediate (like your Power Automate flow or an Azure Function) that your web part calls. This avoids CORS issues and hides the API key from the client. For now, let’s illustrate a direct call, and later we’ll integrate the Power Automate flow as the better approach.

- **Add UI elements:** In the React component’s JSX, create a simple chat interface: an `<input>` or `<TextField>` for the user’s question, a `<button>` to submit, and a `<div>` or `<Text>` area to display the answer.

- **Calling OpenAI API with fetch:** On button click, gather the user’s question and call the API. For example:

  ```ts
  const apiKey = "<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"; // Replace with secure fetch in production
  const prompt = userQuestion; // from state or ref
  const apiUrl = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions";

  const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiKey}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", 
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
    })
  });
  const result = await response.json();
  const answer = result.choices[0].message.content;
  ```

  This payload uses the Chat Completions endpoint with the user’s prompt. (If using the older completion endpoint or a different model, the JSON would differ.) The above snippet is the essence: a POST to `.../chat/completions` with an authorization header and JSON body ([Could be I used an older API with the newer model. But there was no loop around ... | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35117433#:~:text=fetch%28,messages)) ([Could be I used an older API with the newer model. But there was no loop around ... | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35117433#:~:text=%7B,turbo)). 

  **Important:** *Never commit the API key in your code repository.* For now, you might hard-code it for a quick test, but the final solution should **not expose the key on the client side**. We’ll address securing the key in the Best Practices section.

- **Update state with the answer:** Once you get the `answer` string, update the component state to display it in the UI. You might also append the question & answer to a conversation history shown in the web part.

- **Loading and error handling:** Provide feedback while waiting for the API (e.g., a spinner or “Thinking…” message). Also, handle errors (e.g., API returns an error or network fails) by catching exceptions and informing the user.

**3.4 Example Code Snippet (React component):**

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';

const ChatGPTWebPart: React.FC = () => {
  const [question, setQuestion] = React.useState("");
  const [answer, setAnswer] = React.useState("");
  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(false);

  const askChatGPT = async () => {
    if (!question) return;
    setLoading(true);
    setAnswer("");
    try {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          "Authorization": `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`  // replace appropriately
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
          messages: [{ role: "user", content: question }]
        })
      });
      const data = await response.json();
      const chatGPTAnswer = data?.choices?.[0]?.message?.content;
      setAnswer(chatGPTAnswer || "(No answer)");
    } catch(err) {
      console.error("ChatGPT API error", err);
      setAnswer("Error: Unable to get response.");
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="chatGPTWebPart">
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={question} 
        onChange={e => setQuestion(e.target.value)} 
        placeholder="Ask a question..." />
      <button onClick={askChatGPT}>Ask</button>
      {loading && <p>Loading...</p>}
      {answer && <p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> {answer}</p>}
    </div>
  );
};
```

This simplistic example uses a functional React component. In a real SPFx web part, you would integrate this into the default component the Yeoman generator created, or adjust accordingly. 

**3.5 Integrate with SharePoint (using PnPjs):** The web part can also perform SharePoint operations. For instance, if you want the conversation to include SharePoint data (“ChatGPT, list my tasks”), you could call SharePoint REST API via PnPjs and include the results in the prompt. Or if ChatGPT’s response should trigger an action (“Create a new list called Project X”), your code could detect that and use PnPjs to execute it. We’ll cover PnPjs in section 5, but note that your SPFx web part is where PnPjs can be called with the current user context (meaning it respects the user’s permissions). 

**3.6 Build and Deploy the Web Part:** Once your web part is working locally (test it in the SharePoint Workbench or a test site), you’re ready to deploy it to your tenant:

- **Bundle and Package:** Run `gulp bundle --ship` then `gulp package-solution --ship`. This creates the `.sppkg` package in the `sharepoint/solution` folder.
- **Upload to App Catalog:** Go to your SharePoint Online App Catalog site (ensure one is created if not). Upload the `.sppkg` file to the **Apps for SharePoint** library. This makes the solution available tenant-wide (or to that site collection if using a site collection app catalog).
- **App Deployment:** After uploading, SharePoint will prompt you to **deploy** the solution. It may ask for confirmation if the web part requests API permissions or if it’s set to tenant-wide deployment. Click **Deploy** to trust it. If you used any web API permissions (delegated Graph, etc.), an admin needs to approve those in the SharePoint admin center’s API access page.
- **Add to a SharePoint Page:** Now, in any site, you can insert the web part on a modern page. Edit a page, click **+** to add web part, and find your “ChatGPT Assistant” (or whatever you named it). It should load up and be ready to use (assuming you either configured the API key somewhere or your back-end integration is set).

At this stage, you have a basic ChatGPT web part running. Next, we’ll integrate Power Automate so that instead of calling the OpenAI API directly from the browser (which has security and CORS implications), we route calls through a flow.

## 4. Power Automate Integration

**Goal:** Use Power Automate to handle calls between ChatGPT and SharePoint (and to secure our OpenAI API usage). Power Automate can act as a middle layer: the SPFx web part sends the user’s question to a flow, the flow calls the OpenAI API (and possibly performs SharePoint actions), then returns a response which the web part displays. This approach hides the OpenAI API key on the server side (Flow) and can combine multiple steps.

**4.1 Create a Power Automate Flow for ChatGPT Q&A:** 

We will set up an HTTP-triggered flow that accepts a question and returns an answer:

1. **Create an Instant Cloud Flow:** In Power Automate (make.powerautomate.com), create a new flow and choose **Instant cloud flow** > **When an HTTP request is received** (this trigger is under the “built-in” triggers). This will generate a unique URL for the flow after you save it. This trigger allows the flow to be called via a web request from your SPFx web part (or any application). 

2. **Define the Request schema (optional):** You can define the expected JSON structure of the incoming request. For simplicity, let’s assume the web part will send a JSON like `{ "question": "<<<user's question>>>" }`. In the trigger, click **Use sample payload to generate schema**, and paste an example: `{"question": "How many documents do we have?"}`. This will create an input variable (e.g., triggerBody()?['question']) for use in the flow.

3. **Add an HTTP action to call OpenAI:** Add a new step **HTTP** (this is a premium action). Configure it as:
   - Method: POST
   - URI: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` (for the ChatGPT endpoint) or `.../v1/completions` for older models.
   - Headers: 
     - Content-Type: application/json
     - Authorization: Bearer **<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>** (put your API key here). It’s good practice to store this securely; for example, you could use Azure Key Vault and the **Key Vault** connector to retrieve the key, or at least store it in an environment variable/secret if using solutions. In a simple flow, you might paste it directly, but remember anyone with edit rights to the flow can see it.
   - Body: a JSON payload. You can use the question from the trigger in the body. For instance:
     ```json
     {
       "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
       "messages": [
         {"role": "user", "content": "@{triggerBody()?['question']}"}
       ]
     }
     ```
     The above uses an expression to inject the question from the trigger into the JSON. If using the older completion endpoint, the body might look like the one in the screenshot below (model, prompt, etc.). 

    ([Using OpenAI APIs with Power Automate - Nanddeep Nachan Blogs](https://nanddeepn.github.io/posts/2023-01-24-openai-api-power-automate/)) *Power Automate HTTP action to call OpenAI.* (This example posts to the OpenAI API with a prompt variable. Note the API key in the Authorization header and JSON body with model and prompt.)

   When this action runs, it will call the OpenAI API and receive a response (JSON with the completion). However, by default the flow will not return that response to the caller – we need a Response step.

4. **Parse the OpenAI response (optional):** You might add a **Parse JSON** action to easily extract the text from the response. Use the JSON schema from OpenAI’s response (you can get it by running the flow once or from OpenAI docs). Alternatively, skip this and handle it in the web part.

5. **Respond to the HTTP request:** Finally, add a **Response** action (found under Request). You can set the status code to 200 and in the body, pass the answer. For example:
   ```json
   {
     "answer": "@{body('HTTP')?['choices'][0]['message']['content']}"
   }
   ```
   If you parsed JSON, you could use that output. The idea is to send back a simple JSON with the answer text.

6. **Save the flow.** Copy the HTTP trigger URL generated (it will contain a long URL including an access key). This URL will be used by your SPFx web part to invoke the flow.

**4.2 Securing the Flow:** The HTTP trigger URL contains a validation signature (a SAS token), which means it’s essentially a secret URL – only calls with that URL (including the secret) will trigger the flow. Treat it like a password. Do not expose it publicly beyond what’s needed (in SPFx, consider storing it in a config file or environment-specific information, not hard-coded in visible client script if possible).

**4.3 Integrating the Flow with the SPFx Web Part:** 

Now, update your web part code to use the flow’s URL instead of calling OpenAI directly:

- Instead of `fetch` to `api.openai.com`, you’ll `fetch` to your flow’s HTTP URL. The body can be `{ "question": "user's question text" }`. You don’t need an Authorization header (the flow URL already includes an auth token in the query string). 
- This call will *not* have CORS issues if done correctly, because Microsoft’s flow endpoint will allow it. The flow’s response (our JSON answer) should be returned.

Example in the web part (replace previous direct API call with): 

```ts
const flowUrl = "<Your_Flow_Http_Post_URL>";
const response = await fetch(flowUrl, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ question: prompt })
});
const data = await response.json();
setAnswer(data.answer);
```

**4.4 Using Power Automate to interact with SharePoint:** The flow can do more than just call OpenAI. You can incorporate SharePoint steps. For example, suppose a user asks, “How many items are in List ABC?” You could have the flow first call a SharePoint action to get the item count, then feed that into the OpenAI prompt, then return the answer. Or the user says “Create a new task for John”, you could have the flow parse that (with AI or keywords) and then use **Create item** in SharePoint. 

Some ideas:
- Use **“Send an HTTP request to SharePoint”** action in the flow to perform operations (like create list, add item, read items). This uses a connection (likely your user or a service account) to SharePoint. Keep in mind, Power Automate’s SharePoint connector uses user context – if you run the flow under your credentials, actions are done as you. If you want to use the service principal, currently you’d have to use the Graph HTTP as discussed (since SharePoint connector doesn’t support service principals directly ([

- Alternatively, have the flow call Microsoft Graph (using an HTTP action with the app’s token as described in section 2) to perform tasks, especially if using application permissions (for example, to write to a site where the user might not have access).

**4.5 Example: Flow to Answer SharePoint Query via ChatGPT:**  
Imagine a flow triggered by HTTP with input “What is the latest file in the Policies library?”. The flow could: 
  - Use a SharePoint action to list files in “Policies” document library (REST API or Graph).
  - Take the top result (latest modified file’s name).
  - Form a prompt like: “User asked: 'What is the latest file in Policies library?'. The latest file is XYZ.docx modified on 2023-10-10. Answer the user with this info.” 
  - Send that to OpenAI (HTTP action).
  - Return the AI-crafted answer, which might be a nicely phrased sentence about the latest file. 

This demonstrates you can combine data retrieval and AI in the flow. 

**4.6 Testing the Flow integration:** With your web part now pointing to the flow, go to SharePoint, refresh the page with the web part, and ask a question. The flow should trigger (you can see run history in Power Automate), call OpenAI, and respond. The answer should appear in the web part. The user experience should be the same, but now you’ve moved the AI call to a secure server side.

## 5. PnP & PnPjs Implementation

**Purpose:** Use PnP (Patterns & Practices) libraries to simplify SharePoint operations from our custom ChatGPT solution. PnPjs is a JavaScript library that works well in SPFx to call SharePoint or Graph API in a fluent way. PnP (PowerShell or .NET) can be used in back-end automation if needed.

**5.1 Using PnPjs in the SPFx Web Part:** If you want the web part to execute SharePoint tasks in response to ChatGPT (for instance, ChatGPT decides to create a list or fetch some data), you can call SharePoint directly via PnPjs using the current user’s context:

- **Install PnPjs:** In your SPFx project, run: `npm install @pnp/sp @pnp/graph --save`. (We include both sp and graph libraries; use what you need.) Also import the required modules in your code.

- **Initialize PnPjs context:** In your web part file (e.g., `WebPart.ts`), import `{ spfi, SPFx } from "@pnp/sp"` and call `spfi().using(SPx(this.context))` in the `onInit` method of the web part. This binds PnPjs to the current SPFx context (which has the SharePoint URL and the user's auth token). For example:
  ```ts
  import { spfi, SPFx } from "@pnp/sp";
  ...
  public async onInit(): Promise<void> {
    await super.onInit();
    this._sp = spfi().using(SPFx(this.context));
    return Promise.resolve();
  }
  ```
  Now `this._sp` is a PnPjs SP object you can use to query SharePoint. (If using PnPjs v3, this is the pattern. In older v2, you might use `sp.setup({ spfxContext: this.context })`.) By doing this, PnPjs knows the web’s URL and will perform REST calls with the current user identity ([Use @pnp/sp (PnPJS) library with SharePoint Framework web parts | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/guidance/use-sp-pnp-js-with-spfx-web-parts#:~:text=the%20factory%20instance,getSP)).

- **Perform operations:** PnPjs allows intuitive calls. For example:
  ```ts
  // Ensure this._sp is initialized as above
  const web = this._sp.web;
  // Get all items from a list
  const items = await web.lists.getByTitle("Announcements").items();
  // Create a new list item
  await web.lists.getByTitle("Tasks").items.add({ Title: "New Task from ChatGPT" });
  // Create a new list (using the ensure method)
  await web.lists.ensure("Project X", "Project X list created by ChatGPT", 100); // 100=GenericList template
  ```
  You can call these based on certain triggers. Perhaps you interpret certain keywords in the chat: e.g., if the user question starts with "Create list", you call the ensure list method, and then have ChatGPT respond with a confirmation like "I have created the list 'Project X' for you."

- **PnPjs and ChatGPT interplay:** Deciding *what* to execute on SharePoint could be a challenge – you might use basic keyword matching or even have ChatGPT return a structured command. A sophisticated approach is to use OpenAI’s function calling feature: you define “functions” (like createList(name)) that ChatGPT can choose to invoke, and then your code executes it and returns the result to ChatGPT. Implementing that fully is advanced, but keep in mind it’s possible ([Build an AI-Powered Personal Assistant with SPFx and OpenAI ...](https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/build-an-aipowered-personal-assistant-with-spfx-and-openai-function-calling-969200#:~:text=Build%20an%20AI,Open%20AI%27s%20function%20calling%20feature)) (the Toolify blog and others demonstrate using function calling in SPFx for a personal assistant web part).

- **Security:** PnPjs calls are made as the logged-in user. This means ChatGPT cannot perform anything the user themselves cannot (which is good for safety). If the user lacks permission (say they ask to delete a site), the PnPjs call will fail. You may want to handle that and have ChatGPT respond with an error message like “Sorry, I cannot do that.” For elevated privileges, you’d need to call a service (like a flow with app permissions) instead of using the user context.

**5.2 Using PnP PowerShell or PnP Core SDK (optional):** If some tasks are better done outside SPFx (like heavy provisioning), you could use PnP PowerShell scripts or Azure Functions with PnP Core SDK. For example, a Power Automate flow could trigger an Azure Automation runbook that runs a PnP PowerShell script for complex site provisioning when ChatGPT is asked to “Create a new project site.” This is an architectural consideration – if needed, mention in documentation for future enhancements. The general steps would be similar: authenticate with the service principal (which might require a certificate since SharePoint app-only via secret doesn’t work for CSOM, but Graph can handle site creation through APIs).

**5.3 Example Scenario – Combining PnPjs and ChatGPT:** A user asks in the web part: “List all my open tasks and summarize.” The integration can:
   - Use PnPjs to fetch items from the “Tasks” list assigned to that user where Status != Completed.
   - Feed that list (perhaps just the titles or count) into ChatGPT: e.g., prompt the model: “The user has 5 open tasks: Task A, Task B, … Summarize or respond with encouragement to complete them.”
   - ChatGPT then produces a nice summary or message.
   - Web part displays it. 

This way, ChatGPT’s response is grounded in actual SharePoint data retrieved via PnPjs.

**5.4 Summary:** PnPjs is your friend for any SharePoint operation from within the SPFx web part. It abstracts away REST calls and handles auth via the SPFx context. Ensure you initialize it with the context ([Use @pnp/sp (PnPJS) library with SharePoint Framework web parts | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/guidance/use-sp-pnp-js-with-spfx-web-parts#:~:text=public%20async%20onInit%28%29%3A%20Promise,getEnvironmentMessage)) and you can then perform reads and writes easily. Use PnP (PowerShell/Graph) on server-side if you need app-only context outside the user’s permissions (in flows or Azure functions). 

With the front-end and back-end pieces in place, we have a functional ChatGPT integration in SharePoint. Now, let’s see how we can use it beyond just the SharePoint page – e.g., in the ChatGPT interface itself.

## 6. Using the Custom ChatGPT in the Windows 11 ChatGPT App

OpenAI provides a ChatGPT application (and web interface) where you normally interact with ChatGPT directly. The question is how to use our **custom ChatGPT integration** within that environment. In other words, can the ChatGPT UI or app talk to our SharePoint or run our flows? The answer lies in ChatGPT’s **Plugins** feature – specifically, the Microsoft Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT.

OpenAI allows third-party plugins that extend ChatGPT’s capabilities. Microsoft has created a **Power Automate ChatGPT plugin** that lets ChatGPT trigger your Power Automate flows (including the ones we built) ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=The%20Power%20Automate%20plugin%20for,from%20the%20Skills%20Plugins%20connector)) ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=Get%20the%20plugin)). By leveraging this, you can essentially ask ChatGPT (in the ChatGPT app) to run flows which perform actions in SharePoint.

**6.1 Prerequisites for ChatGPT Plugins:** 
- You must have a **ChatGPT Plus** subscription to use plugins ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=,Power%20Automate%20plugin%20for%20ChatGPT)), and select the GPT-4 model when using them.
- The Power Automate plugin is available for standard (commercial) cloud accounts (it might not work with government or national clouds yet).

**6.2 Installing the Power Automate Plugin in ChatGPT:** 

1. Open the ChatGPT app (or web interface) and ensure you have GPT-4 selected. Enable Plugins by going to *Settings > Beta Features* and toggling **Plugins** on ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=2,and%20enable%20the%20Plugins%20toggle)).
2. Start a new chat, choose GPT-4, then click the **Plugins** dropdown. Select **Plugin Store** and search for “Power Automate”. 
3. Click **Install** on the Power Automate plugin ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=4.%20Hover%20over%20GPT,select%20Plugins)). You will be prompted to sign in with your Microsoft account (use the same account where your flows are, i.e., your Office 365 account) and authorize ChatGPT to access Power Automate ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=8,Power%20Automate%20account)). Approve the permission request.

 ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin)) *Installing the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT.* (In the ChatGPT plugin store, you can find the Power Automate plugin and install it.)

4. Once installed and connected, the plugin can be used in conversations.

**6.3 Running Your Custom Flows via ChatGPT:** The Power Automate plugin allows ChatGPT to list and run flows in your account. Only flows that use the special **“Run from Copilot”** trigger (previously called “Run from ChatGPT”) are directly invokable by name ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=The%20Run%20from%20copilot%20trigger,conversation%20use%20the%20following%20steps)). However, any flow (including ones with an HTTP trigger) can be listed and run via a generic request.

- **Listing flows:** You can ask ChatGPT something like *“List my flows”* and it will display flows from your Power Automate (that have the Copilot trigger) ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=You%20can%20run%20flows%20that,before%20submitting%20the%20flow%20run)).
- **Running a flow:** If you want ChatGPT to execute a specific flow, one way is to create a new flow using the **Run from Copilot** trigger. This trigger doesn’t require an HTTP call; instead, it makes the flow available to the ChatGPT plugin directly. You can create a flow with **Run from Copilot** trigger that then calls your actual flow (or contains logic similar to your HTTP flow). For example, a Copilot-triggered flow “ChatGPT SharePoint Q&A” could accept a text input and then internally call the OpenAI API and SharePoint actions (like our earlier flow) and perhaps use a **Respond to Copilot** action to send an answer back ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=4,V2)).

- **Example usage:** You could type to ChatGPT: *“Use Power Automate to run the ‘ChatGPT SharePoint Q&A’ flow. The question is: 'What are my pending tasks?'. ”* ChatGPT (via the plugin) will identify the flow and attempt to run it. It typically provides a card or link to actually execute the flow (for safety, flows are not run blindly – you get a chance to confirm) ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=1,and%20input%20parameters%20before%20submitting)). Once run, it can show the output that the flow generates (if the flow uses “Respond to Copilot” action or just ends, ChatGPT will retrieve any output).

- **Creating flows via ChatGPT:** Interestingly, the plugin also allows ChatGPT to **create new flows from natural language** ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=When%20you%20use%20a%20prompt,creating%20automated%20and%20scheduled%20flows)) – for example, if you say “Create a flow that emails me when a SharePoint item is added,” it will draft a flow for you. This is outside our current scope but shows the power of integrating these tools.

**6.4 Using the ChatGPT Windows 11 App with your integration:** After setting up the plugin, you can simply converse with ChatGPT in the app and invoke your SharePoint-connected automations. For instance:
   - “Hey ChatGPT, what’s the latest news on our SharePoint site?” – If you have a flow that searches a news list and returns an answer, ChatGPT can trigger it and incorporate the results.
   - “ChatGPT, add a task for me to follow up with client ABC next week.” – If you made a flow that creates Planner tasks or SharePoint tasks, ChatGPT can call it (perhaps after confirming details with you) and then say “Task created.”

Behind the scenes, your SPFx web part is not involved in this case; it’s ChatGPT directly talking to Power Automate. So think of this as an **alternative interface** to interact with the same backend pieces. Users can either use the SharePoint page with the chat web part, or if they have ChatGPT Plus, use the ChatGPT app with the plugin to achieve similar results in a conversational way. This is a bonus – it was not strictly required to get the solution running, but it shows interoperability.

**6.5 Considerations:** The plugin approach requires users to have ChatGPT Plus (paid) and some technical setup (which we outlined). If that’s not available to all users, your SPFx web part remains the primary interface for general users. Also, be mindful that flows run from ChatGPT plugin still run under your account (or the connections within the flow). Ensure any flow that can be run by ChatGPT is safe (ChatGPT could misunderstand a user query and run something unintended – but it will always ask for confirmation by giving you a link to run the flow manually as of the current design ([Use the Power Automate plugin for ChatGPT - Power Automate | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/use-chatgpt-plugin#:~:text=1,and%20input%20parameters%20before%20submitting))).

## 7. Deployment & Best Practices

Finally, as you deploy the solution to production, keep these best practices in mind to ensure a secure, maintainable implementation:

**7.1 Secure your API Keys and Secrets:** Never leave the OpenAI API key exposed client-side (in the SPFx code). Our solution moved the call to a server-side flow, which is good. Ensure the Power Automate flow’s URL (with the token) is kept secret. If you used an Azure Function instead, store the key in Azure Key Vault or app settings. **Rotate keys periodically** if possible. OpenAI keys can be regenerated – update your flows accordingly. Remember, any user with access to edit the flow could see the key in the HTTP action. If your environment supports environment variables or the new Managed Environments feature for Power Platform, use those to hide the key. OpenAI’s own guidance: treat API keys like passwords ([sharepoint online - It is fine if we store the Chat GPT api key inside the SPFx web part properties - SharePoint Stack Exchange](https://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/questions/306622/it-is-fine-if-we-store-the-chat-gpt-api-key-inside-the-spfx-web-part-properties#:~:text=No%2C%20secret%20API%20keys%20shouldn%27t,practices%20for%20API%20key%20safety)).

**7.2 Principle of Least Privilege:** The Azure AD app we created in step 2 should have only the minimal permissions needed. If you granted Sites.ReadWrite.All to experiment, consider if you can restrict it later (maybe to specific site collections via Sites.Selected). Likewise, any flows or scripts should run in contexts that have only the needed access (e.g., don’t use a global tenant admin account for a flow connection if a Site Owner account would suffice). This limits potential damage if something goes wrong.

**7.3 Performance and Quotas:** ChatGPT API has rate limits depending on your OpenAI account. Monitor the usage in your OpenAI dashboard. If your organization will use this heavily, you might hit rate or monthly spend limits. OpenAI allows setting hard limits on usage – consider doing that to avoid surprises. Also, the flow approach adds a bit of latency (the HTTP call from SPFx to flow, then to OpenAI and back). Usually this is a few seconds. Ensure you handle this gracefully in the UI (a loading indicator). For faster responses and streaming answers (token by token), a direct integration or Azure Function using the streaming API would be needed – that’s an advanced improvement.

**7.4 User Education and Expectations:** If deploying widely, educate users on what this ChatGPT integration can and cannot do. For example, if it’s not connected to company data beyond SharePoint, it won’t answer questions about external info. It also should not be used for sensitive data queries unless you’ve verified compliance. Include a disclaimer like “Do not enter confidential information” if needed, since that data is going to OpenAI.

**7.5 Maintenance:** Maintain documentation of how the system is set up: the SPFx solution (source code in a repository), the Azure AD app (client ID, permissions), and the Power Automate flows (maybe export them as a backup). This will help if you need to update or someone else takes over. Regularly check for updates to SPFx (new versions can bring improvements or require Node updates), PnPjs (keep it updated for latest fixes), and any changes in OpenAI API (new model endpoints, deprecations). 

When updating the SPFx web part, increment the version in the `package-solution.json` and follow the normal deployment (upload new .sppkg, replace the old version, and possibly re-trust if new permissions added). Flows should be tested in a dev environment (Power Platform has the concept of solutions and environments – consider using those for dev/test/prod separation).

**7.6 Logging and Error Handling:** Implement logging for critical actions. In Power Automate, you might log to Application Insights or send yourself an email if a flow fails or if ChatGPT returns an error. In SPFx, you could log errors to the console or a SharePoint list for audit. This will help troubleshoot issues (like if OpenAI API changes or a particular query crashes the flow).

**7.7 Responsible AI and Usage:** Ensure the usage of ChatGPT follows your company’s guidelines. For instance, if users ask it to generate content, they should review it (the AI might not always be correct). Also, monitor for any inappropriate use. OpenAI’s content filters might return an error if a user asks something against policy; handle that case (perhaps “I cannot assist with that request.” message).

**7.8 Testing with Users:** Before full deployment, do a pilot with a few users. Gather feedback on the answers ChatGPT provides for your domain-specific questions. You might need to adjust the system prompts or few-shot examples to guide ChatGPT. For example, you can prepend a system message: “You are a SharePoint assistant. Keep answers brief and cite SharePoint data when relevant.” The OpenAI API allows sending a system message in the chat payload to influence the style.

**7.9 Future Enhancements:** With the core in place, you can enhance the integration. Consider adding:
- **Adaptive Cards or a custom UI** for a richer chat experience in the web part.
- **Contextual awareness**: If the web part is on a page, perhaps feed the page name or site name as context (so ChatGPT knows where it is).
- **Multi-turn conversations**: Maintain the conversation context by sending previous Q&A in the `messages` array so that ChatGPT can have a stateful dialogue.
- **Integration with Teams:** You could surface this ChatGPT assistant in Microsoft Teams as a custom app or messaging extension (SPFx can be exposed in Teams). Power Virtual Agents is another approach to create a Teams chatbot that could use your flows to call OpenAI.

In conclusion, by following these steps, you have set up a custom ChatGPT integration in SharePoint Online using SPFx, secured by Azure AD, automated with Power Automate, and extended with PnP for SharePoint operations. Users can interact with it on SharePoint pages, and with the Power Automate plugin, even through the ChatGPT app. Always keep security and maintenance in mind as you roll this out. Happy coding, and enjoy your new AI-powered SharePoint experience!
