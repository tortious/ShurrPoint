To create a document set for each open case using your existing SharePoint setup, here’s how you can go about it. You can leverage document sets to manage related files in a centralized, organized way for each case, following these steps:

1. Enable Document Sets Feature

First, you need to make sure that the Document Set feature is enabled in your SharePoint site collection. Here’s how to do that:

	1.	Go to your SharePoint Admin Center.
	2.	Navigate to Settings.
	3.	Under Site Collection Features, find Document Sets and click Activate.

2. Create a New Content Type for Document Sets

Since each case needs its own document set, you’ll need to create a custom content type that is based on Document Sets.

	1.	Navigate to Site Settings in your SharePoint Case Management hub.
	2.	Under Site Columns, click on Content Types.
	3.	Select Create to make a new content type. Base it on the Document Set content type. Give it a meaningful name, such as “Case Document Set”.
	4.	Once created, you can customize the content type:
	•	Add metadata columns (e.g., Case Number, Client Name, Adjuster, etc.) to this content type by adding site columns.
	•	Configure the default documents for the document set, such as templates for pleadings, claim summaries, etc.

3. Add the Document Set Content Type to Your Library

Now, you’ll add the custom document set content type to your case document library:

	1.	Go to your document library where you want to store the document sets.
	2.	Click on the Library Settings.
	3.	Under Advanced Settings, make sure that Allow management of content types is set to Yes.
	4.	Go back to Library Settings, and under Content Types, click on Add from existing site content types.
	5.	Select the Case Document Set content type that you just created and add it.

4. Create a New Document Set for Each Case

Now you can create a document set for each open case:

	1.	Go to the document library where you added the Case Document Set content type.
	2.	Click on New, and select Case Document Set (or whatever you named your content type).
	3.	When creating each document set, fill in the metadata fields like Case Number, Client Name, etc., that are specific to the case.

5. Automate Document Set Creation with Power Automate

Since you’ve mentioned wanting automation, you can set up a flow in Power Automate to automatically create a document set when a new item is added to your JEFF case management list.

Here’s an overview of how to do this:

	1.	Create a new flow that triggers when a new item is added to your JEFF list.
	2.	Use the Send an HTTP Request to SharePoint action to create a document set in the appropriate library, using the case metadata (e.g., Court Number) as part of the document set name.
	3.	Link the document set to the corresponding team site using a URL or metadata.

6. Display Document Sets on Case Sites

You can add web parts to display these document sets directly on your case team sites:

	1.	Go to the case’s team site.
	2.	Edit the page and add a Document Library web part.
	3.	Filter the web part view to display only the relevant document sets based on the case metadata.

This way, each open case will have a corresponding document set that stores all relevant documents. You can link these sets to your existing Assignment File Dump or create new ones specifically for documents related to pleadings or court filings.
