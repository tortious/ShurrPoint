Adding buttons for common actions like “Add New Matter,” “Upload Document,” and others can streamline your workflow, making it intuitive for team members to add and update case information. Here’s how to set these up in SharePoint:

1. Creating Custom Buttons with Power Apps or Quick Links

Power Apps Button

	•	Setup: If you’d like a more interactive button, consider using Power Apps to create a custom form that guides users through adding a new matter. Power Apps can integrate directly with your SharePoint list and offers flexibility for capturing fields specific to each case.
	•	Embedding in SharePoint: After creating the Power App, embed it on your site as a button using the Power Apps Web Part or link it in a custom HTML button.

Quick Links for Basic Buttons

	•	Quick Links Web Part: A simpler option is to use the Quick Links Web Part to create buttons. You can style them as tiles, buttons, or icons, and they can link directly to SharePoint lists, document libraries, or specific actions.
	•	Add New Matter: Set a link to your “Cases” list or library, configured to open the new item form directly. You can set the link by selecting “New Item” in the list and copying the URL to use in the button link.

2. Buttons for Uploading Documents

	•	Direct Upload Link: For each case site, add a Quick Link button called “Upload Document” that opens the document library upload form. This can point directly to the library where you want the documents stored.
	•	Targeted Libraries: If each case has a specific document library, set up the button to go to that library’s upload page. The link typically follows this structure:

[YourSiteURL]/[LibraryName]/Forms/Upload.aspx



3. Enhanced Button Actions with Power Automate

	•	For more advanced functionality, such as automating document naming conventions or notifying the team when a document is added, set up a Power Automate Flow to trigger upon document upload.
	•	The flow can automatically categorize, rename, or send notifications, further enhancing the button’s functionality.

4. Styling and Positioning Buttons for Accessibility

	•	Position the buttons prominently on the case landing page (e.g., in a hero web part or at the top of the case overview). This layout can improve usability by centralizing all main actions in one place.
	•	Use custom icons or colors to make each button visually distinct for quick identification.

Example of How It Would Look on the Site:

	•	Button Row: At the top of each case page, you could have a row of buttons like “Add New Matter,” “Upload Document,” “View Calendar Events,” and “Update Status.”
	•	Tooltip Descriptions: Add tooltips to each button for extra guidance on their purpose and action.

This setup creates an intuitive user experience, helping your team perform key actions right from the case site without needing to navigate to different areas of SharePoint. Let me know if you want more specifics on setting up any of these!
