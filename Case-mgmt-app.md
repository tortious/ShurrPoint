To build a **Case Management app** in Power Apps using your existing SharePoint lists, you’ll want to structure your app to connect and relate data from your key lists (Case Management, Party Contacts, Counsel Contacts, and Mark Schedule). Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create a functional Power App for your case management needs:

### 1. **Define Your Key Requirements**
   - **Main List**: The **Case Management** list will act as the core list, storing key case details.
   - **Related Lists**: 
     - **Party Contacts**: Will store contact information for involved parties (plaintiffs, defendants, witnesses, etc.).
     - **Counsel Contacts**: Will store the contact information for legal counsel (both internal and external).
     - **Mark Schedule**: Acts as a calendar to track important case dates like court hearings or filing deadlines.

### 2. **Create the Power App from SharePoint Lists**
   Power Apps can connect directly to SharePoint lists. Here’s how to set up the app:
   
   - **Go to Power Apps Studio**: In your Office 365 account, open **Power Apps Studio**.
   - **Start from Data**: Choose “Start from data” and select SharePoint as your data source.
   - **Connect Your Lists**: Connect to your SharePoint site and select the relevant lists: **Case Management**, **Party Contacts**, **Counsel Contacts**, and **Mark Schedule**.

### 3. **Design the User Interface (UI)**
   Structure your app with clear screens to access and manage each list:
   
   - **Home Screen**: Start with a dashboard that provides an overview of cases. This can include a gallery or list showing **Case Management** data.
   - **Case Details Screen**: Create a screen that shows detailed information about a selected case. When a user selects a case from the gallery, navigate to a detailed view where the case information (including related parties, counsel, and schedules) is displayed.

### 4. **Use Lookup Columns for Related Data**
   Since **Case Management** is your baseline list, use **lookup columns** in the **Party Contacts** and **Counsel Contacts** lists to connect them to the relevant cases:
   
   - In Power Apps, you can display related data from different lists using **LookUp** functions. For example, when you view a case, you can display related party and counsel details by looking up the case ID.
   
   **Example**: Use a `LookUp` formula in Power Apps to display the party contacts for a selected case:
   ```PowerApps
   LookUp(PartyContacts, CaseID = ThisItem.CaseID)
   ```
   This formula pulls in the relevant contacts for a case based on the **CaseID**.

### 5. **Connect the Calendar (Mark Schedule)**
   - You can set up a **Calendar View** using the **Mark Schedule** list to track deadlines or important dates associated with each case.
   - Add a calendar screen to your Power App using the **Calendar Control** to display data from the **Mark Schedule** list.
   - **Filter by Case**: Use a filter to show only the events related to a specific case.
   
   **Example**: Use a `Filter` function to show scheduled events for the current case:
   ```PowerApps
   Filter(MarkSchedule, CaseID = ThisItem.CaseID)
   ```

### 6. **Forms for Adding and Editing Data**
   - For each screen, use **Forms** in Power Apps to enable users to add or edit information. These forms can be connected to SharePoint lists for **Case Management**, **Party Contacts**, **Counsel Contacts**, and **Mark Schedule**.
   - Set up a form to allow users to input case information, add or edit contacts, and mark important dates on the schedule.

### 7. **Filter and Search Features**
   To make the app more functional, add filtering and search capabilities:
   - **Search Bar**: Allow users to search through cases, party contacts, or counsel contacts by keywords (e.g., client name or case number).
   - **Filter by Case Status**: Add a filter to display cases based on their status (e.g., open, closed, pending).
   
   **Example**: Use the `Search` function to allow users to search the **Case Management** list by case name or number:
   ```PowerApps
   Search(CaseManagement, SearchInput.Text, "CaseName")
   ```

### 8. **Navigation between Screens**
   - Set up navigation so that users can move easily between the case list, detailed case view, contact details, and schedule.
   - Use the **Navigate** function to open the relevant screen when a user clicks on a case or contact.
   
   **Example**:
   ```PowerApps
   Navigate(CaseDetailsScreen, ScreenTransition.Fade)
   ```

### 9. **Enhance with Conditional Formatting and Notifications**
   - **Conditional Formatting**: Highlight upcoming deadlines or overdue tasks in your **Mark Schedule** with color-coding.
   - **Notifications**: Use **Power Automate** to trigger email notifications for important events, such as approaching court dates or case milestones.

### 10. **Publish and Share the App**
   - Once you’ve built and tested your app, you can **publish** it and share it with the other users in your firm.
   - Assign appropriate permissions in **Power Apps** and **SharePoint** to ensure that users can only access and modify the data they’re allowed to see.

### Key Components of the App:
1. **Home/Dashboard Screen**: Overview of all cases, with search and filter options.
2. **Case Details Screen**: Display all case-related information, including party contacts, counsel contacts, and key dates.
3. **Contact Management Screens**: Allow users to view, add, or edit party and counsel contacts for each case.
4. **Calendar/Schedule Screen**: Show key case dates, filtered by the selected case, with options to add or modify events.

### Conclusion:
By integrating your SharePoint lists into Power Apps, you can create a **Case Management App** that centralizes your firm’s case information, party and counsel contacts, and schedules. This app will streamline workflows, improve data consistency, and enhance collaboration across your team.
